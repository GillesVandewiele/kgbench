GETESS (German Text Exploitation and Search System) ist der Name eines Projektes mehrerer Partner aus Forschung, Lehre und Industrie, das unterschiedlichste Fachgebiete der Informatik zusammenfuehrt wie Datenbanken, KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz und Linguistik. Ziel der Projektes war die Entwicklung eines prototypischen Informationssystems, das Text- (HTML-) Dokumente mit neuen Technologien einsammelt, abspeichert und mittels natÃ¼rlichsprachlichen Dialogsystems fÃ¼r die Informationsrecherche verfÃ¼gbar macht. Partner des Projektes neben der UniversitÃ¤t Karlsruhe, Institut AIFB, Forschungsgruppe Wissensmanagement waren die GECKO mbH Rostock, der Lehrstuhl Datenbanken und Informationssysteme der UniversitÃ¤t Rostock und das DFKI in SaarbrÃ¼cken."

descriptions of process models. So-called semantic

business process interoperability and interconnectivity.
But, for (semi-) automatic process interoperability

solved. How can similar terms for process element

In this paper we will present solutions for these problems

1114,"none","A number of approaches have been developed for combining wikis with semantic technologies. Many semantic wikis focus on enabling users to specify properties and relationships of individual elements. Complex schema information is typically not edited by the wiki user. Nevertheless, semantic wikis could benefit from taking existing schema information into account, and to allow users to specify additional information based on this schema.

In this paper, we introduce an extension of Semantic MediaWiki that incorporates schema information from existing OWL ontologies. Based on the imported ontology, the system offers automatic classification of articles and aims at supporting the user in editing the wiki knowledge base in a logically consistent manner. We present our prototype implementation which uses the KAON2 ontology management system to integrate reasoning services into our wiki."

Advantages of the population based approach are that it seems promising for solving dynamic optimization problems, its finite state space and the chances it offers for designing new metaheuristics. We compare the behavior of the new approach to the standard ACO approach for several instances of the TSP and the QAP problem. The results show that the new approach is competitive."
1116,"none","A problem-solving method describes a reasoning process that efficiently achieves a goal by applying domain knowledge. However, a problem-solving method cannot directly be applied because of the existence of a gap between, on the one hand, a problem-solving method and the domain knowledge it uses, and, on the other hand, a problem-solving method and the goal that it is supposed to achieve. In this paper, we distinguish two types of assumptions based on an architecture of problem-solving methods, that are able to bridge the gap: one type of assumption is used to strengthen a problem-solving method, and the other to weaken the goal to be achieved. We also show how the effect of one assumption type can be substituted by the effect of the other type, and refer to this as ""the law of conservation of assumptions""."

1168,"none","Abstract. Recent work has shown improvements in text clustering and classification tasks by integrating conceptual features extracted from ontologies. In this paper we present text mining experiments in the medical domain in which the ontological structures used are acquired automatically in an unsupervised learning process from the text corpus in question. We compare results obtained using the automatically learned ontologies with those obtained using manually engineered ones. Our results show that both types of ontologies improve results on text clus-
tering and classification tasks, whereby the automatically acquired ontologies yield an improvement competitive with the manually engineered ones."
1169,"none","Abstract. Richly interlinked, machine-understandable data constitute the basis for the Semantic Web. We provide a framework, S-CREAM, that allows for creation of metadata and is trainable for a speciÂ¯c domain. Annotating web documents is one of the major techniques for creating metadata on the web. The implementation of S-CREAM, Ont-O-Mat supports now the semi-automatic annotation of web pages. This semi- automatic annotation is based on the information extraction component Amilcare. Ont-O-Mat extract with the help of Amilcare knowledge struc- ture from web pages through the use of knowledge extraction rules. These rules are the result of a learning-cycle based on already annotated pages."

Our approach uses ontologies to access sets of distributed XML documents on a conceptual level. We integrate conceptual modeling, inheritance, and inference mechanisms on the one hand with the popularity, simplicity, and flexibility of XML on the other hand. We present an approach that defines the relationship between a given ontology and a document type definition (DTD) for classes of XML documents. Thus, we are able to supplement syntactical access to XML documents by conceptual, i.e. real semantic access."

In 2005 all WPs met at the Joint Knowledge Web Research meeting on 24th-25th January 2005 at Hannover, Germany and the Joint Knowledge Web Research meeting following the ESWC 2nd European Semantic Web Conference, ESWC 2005, in Heraklion, Crete 2nd-3rd May 2005. 

Before M12 the area managers had emphasized additionality instead of duplication of effort, and have encouraged cross collaboration between WPs, the SDK cluster, the WSMO projects and other activities. To strengthen the cross-WP-fertilization we introduced for both meetings in 2005 a new form in addition to regular WP meetings: so-called themed research meetings (aka. join sessions or concertation meetings). For each themed meeting the major topic of one research WP has been highlighted as theme, in January this had been ""Web Services"" and in May this had been ""Language Extensions"". Operationalization of a themed meeting consists of a series of bi-lateral meetings of the highlighted WP with all the remaining ones.

In this deliverable we present a brief overview of the research advance achieved so far which consists of summaries of the results so far achieved in each research work package (WP2.1 Scalability, WP2.2 Heterogeneity, WP2.3 Scalability, WP2.4 Web Services and WP2.5 Language Extensions) and summaries of bi-lateral meetings among different work packages."

1220,"none","Although several approaches have been proposed for modelling an on-line shop assistant, recent customerâ€™s analyses show that they miss some assistance in the buying process. The common problem is that the behaviour of an on-line shop assistant is modelled on the procedural level, i.e. like a workflow. In this paper we present an approach that models this behaviour on the knowledge level, i.e. it takes into account not only which actions (questions) a shop assistant will perform, but also which goals he wants to achieve by taking an action. As a generic reasoning pattern of such an e-shop agent we use the cover-and-differentiate problem-solving method, a method very successfully applied in various diagnosis and classification tasks. In that way, we can (i) model the question-answering process such that the minimal set of useful questions will be provided to a user, (ii) easily reinterpret and fine-tune shopping strategies that exist in other e-shop portals and (iii) design and integrate new methods into generic reasoning pattern. We present an evaluation study which illustrates these benefits."
1221,"none","Although some of the existing approaches for enhancing searching for information in an information portal account for some aspects of usersâ€™ behaviour in the portal, a more systematic treatment of this issue is needed, foremost the role of the content and the structure of a portal on the analysis of usage information. In this paper, we first present the analysis of the factors which the efficient searching depends on and based on it, we propose the conceptual architecture of the management component for an information portal. We assume that the information portal is built around a common taxonomy (in our case an ontology), which is an emerging trend in knowledge management applications we are particularly intereseted in. The management component ensures that searching for information will include all factors which determine the relevance of an information resource, enabling the top-ranking of the highly relevant information resources. The approach is mainly based on tracking usersâ€™ interactions with the portal. We have applied the approach in the information portal of our Institute and an evaluation study is presented."

1258,"none","An empirical evaluation of the ILP system JoJo-FOL is presented. JoJo-FOL uses an iterative method to discover rules for a single concept within the normal inductive logic programming framework. The search process starts with a very restricted hypothesis space to efficiently derive most general and correct clauses first. This strong language bias is weakened by iteratively increasing the number of variables allowed to occur in a clause such that JoJo-FOL is able to induce additional correct but more specific clauses. JoJo-FOL conducts its search through the hypothesis space in a bidirectional manner controlled by two criteria of success derived from the completeness and consistency requirements. In an empirical evaluation JoJo-FOL was tested on two ILP benchmark data sets. The results presented show that the iterative rule discovery method combined with the bidirectional search strategy leads to more general rules and a higher accuracy compared to well-known ILP systems on the tested domains."

1262,"none","An important success factor for the field of KDD lies in the development and integration of methods for supporting the construction and execution of KDD processes. Crucial aspects in this context are the (incremental) development of a precise problem description, a decomposition of this top level problem description into manageable and compatible subtasks which can be reused, and a selection and combination of adequate algorithms for solving these subtasks. In this paper we describe an approach for supporting the systematic decomposition of a KDD process into subtasks and for selecting appropriate problem-solving methods and algorithms for solving these subtasks. Our approach has been partially integrated into the CLEMENTINE system and has been used to develop a real world application in the area of prediction."

1264,"none","An ontology alignment is the expression of relations between different ontologies. In order to view alignments independently from the language expressing ontologies and from the techniques used for finding the alignments, we use a category-theoretical model in which ontologies are the objects. We introduce a categorical structure, called V-alignment, made of a pair of morphisms with a common domain having the ontologies as codomain. This structure serves to design an algebra that describes formally what are ontology merging, alignment composition, union and intersection using categorical constructions. This enables combining alignments of various provenance. Although the desirable properties of this algebra make such abstract manipulation of V-alignments very simple, it is practically not well fitted for expressing complex alignments: expressing subsumption between entities of two different ontologies demands the definition of non-standard categories of ontologies. We consider two approaches to solve this problem. The first one extends the notion of V-alignments to a more complex structure called W-alignments: a formalization of alignments relying on &quot;bridge axioms.&quot; The second one relies on an elaborate concrete category of ontologies that offers high expressive power. We show that these two extensions have different advantages that may be exploited in different contexts (viz., merging, composing, joining or meeting): the first one efficiently processes ontology merging thanks to the possible use of categorical institution theory, while the second one benefits from the simplicity of the algebra of V-alignments."

1266,"none","An ontology over a period of time needs to be modified to reflect changes in the real world, changes in the userâ€™s requirements, drawbacks in the initial design, to incorporate additional functionality or to allow for incremental improvement. Although changes are inevitable during the development and deployment of an ontology, most of the current ontology editors unfortunately do not provide enough support for efficient copying with changes. Since changes are the force that drives the evolution process, in this paper we discuss the requirements for the ontology editors in order to support ontology evolution."
1267,"none","An ontology-based knowledge management system uses an ontology to represent explicit specification of a business domain and to serve as a backbone for providing and searching for knowledge sources. But, dynamically changing business environment implies changes in the conceptualisation of a business domain that are reflected on the underlying domain ontologies. Consequently, these changes have effects on the performances and  validity of the KM system. In this paper we present an approach for enabling consistency of the description 
of knowledge sources in an ontology-based KM system in the case of changes 
in the domain ontology. This approach is based on our research in the ontology evolution and ontology-based annotation of documents. The proposed method is implemented in our semantic annotation framework so that efficient 
acquiring and maintaining of ontology-based metadata is supported."

1359,"none","As CO2 emissions and sustainable energy
production have entered the focus of attention in politics
and industry, ecologically advantageous alternatives are strongly
promoted. We address
virtual power plants from an information technological, economic
and legal perspective in order to enable decentralized
sustainable generation.
For the realization of virtual power plants we draw on a peer-to-peer
infrastructure with market coordination and legal coverage to manage the distributed
generation units and we focus on the combination of power and heat.
Based on our prototype for a decentralized market platform, we
examine the economic and ecological impacts of an increasing
pervasiveness of distributed generation and virtual power plants
as well as their potential influence on society.

At the social level, we consider questions of local immission, but
also of growing awareness for power issues. With regard to the
ecology, we expect a reduction of overall primary energy demand
resulting from reduced transmission and transformation losses and
increased use of combined heat and power plants at a local level
leading to a reduction of emissions. Finally, since local
distributed generation makes more efficient use of primary energy
and long-distance transport lines can be reduced, we expect lower
costs for the complete system as well as reduced uncertainty with
regard to amortization of investments.
Besides a description of the methodology our
presentation will include selected results."

A combination of OWL-DL and rules is desirable for the Semantic Web; however, it might easily lead to the undecidability of interesting reasoning problems. Here, we present a decidable such combination where rules are required to be DL-safe: each variable in the rule is required to occur in a non-DL-atom in the rule body. We discuss the expressive power of such a combination and present an algorithm for query answering in the related logic SHIQ extended with DL-safe rules, based on a reduction to disjunctive programs."

However, one has to ensure that the assumptions and functionality of the reused building block fit to each other and the specific circumstances of the actual problem and knowledge. We use the Karlsruhe Interactive Verifier (KIV) for this purpose. We show how the verification of conceptual and formal specifications of knowledge-based systems can be done with it. KIV was originally developed for the verification of procedural programs but it fits well for verifying knowledge-based systems. Its specification language is based on algebraic specification means for the functional specification of components and dynamic logic for the algorithmic specification. It provides an interactive theorem prover integrated into a sophisticated tool environment supporting aspects like the automatic generation of proof obligations, generation of counter examples, proof management, proof reuse etc. Such a support is essential in making verification of complex specifications feasible. We provide some examples on how to specify and verify tasks, problem-solving methods, and their relationships.

1532,"none","Can you build the Semantic Web in one day? Most likely your answer would be ""No, that&#8217;s impossible."" Let&#8217;s look at a simpler question: Can you build the Web in one day? If you consider the Web in its entirety, your answer would also be ""No."" But what if you think of it as magnitudes smaller? You can build HTML pages in minutes and a simple Web shop in a few hours, including, for example, applying for Web space. All this in the same amount of time it takes your kids to set up a wireless LAN, install a Web server, and create a Web site for the home intranet to show family vacation pictures. You can realize a broad range of applications quite easily.
To determine just how far Semantic Web technologies have come, we wanted to create a snapshot of what you could do by applying and assembling existing Semantic Web technologies &#8212; in one day. Our experiment&#8217;s main aim was to get a feel for the practical applicability of current research by integrating different technologies into something ""up and running."" As an added benefit, we learned a lot about the areas in which the Semantic Web&#8217;s many research directions intersect, such as knowledge representation, natural language processing, and peer-to-peer."

Advantages of workflow-based learning-object management can be seen especially for the customization and personalization of processes and the measurement of results, e.g., economic benefits."
1673,"none","Current middleware solutions, e.g., application servers and Web services, are very complex software products that are hard to tame because of intricacies of distributed systems. Their functionalities have mostly been developed and managed with the help of administration tools and corresponding configuration files, recently in XML. Though this constitutes flexibility for developing and administrating a distributed application, the conceptual model underlying the different configurations is only implicit.

To remedy such problems, Semantic Management of Middleware contributes an ontology-based approach to support the development and administration of middleware-based applications. The ontology is an explicit conceptual model with formal logic-based semantics. Its descriptions may therefore be queried, may foresight required actions, or may be checked to avoid inconsistent system configurations.

This book builds a rigorous approach towards giving the declarative descriptions of components and services a well-defined meaning by specifying ontological foundations and by showing how such foundations may be realized in practical, up-and-running systems."
1674,"none","Currently dozens of XML-based applications exist or are under development. Many of them offer DTDs that define the structure of actual XML documents. Access to these documents relies on special purpose applications or on query languages that are closely tied to the document structures. Our approach uses ontologies to derive a canonical structure, i.e. a DTD, to access sets of distributed XML documents on a conceptual level. We will show how the combination of conceptual modeling, inheritance, and inference mechanisms on the one hand with the popularity, simplicity, and flexibility of XML on the other hand leads to applications providing a broad range of high quality information."
1675,"none","Currently, the variety of expressive extensions and different semantics created for logic programs with negation is diverse and heterogeneous, and there is a lack of comprehensive comparative studies which map out the multitude of perspectives in a uniform way. Most recently, however, new methodologies have been proposed which allow one to derive uniform characterizations of different declarative semantics for logic programs with negation. In this paper, we study the relationship between two of these approaches, namely the level mapping characterizations due to [Hitzler and Wendt 2005], and the selector generated models due to [Schwarz 2004]. We will show that the latter can be captured by means of the former, thereby supporting the claim that level mappings provide a very flexible framework which is applicable to very diversely defined semantics."

Ein Defizit bisheriger Modellierungssprachen, Methoden und Werkzeuge zum kennzahlenbasierten Management von GeschÃ¤ftsprozessen besteht darin, dass GeschÃ¤ftsprozesse und Kennzahlen in getrennten Schemata modelliert werden.

The next generation of the Web, dubbed the &#8216;Semantic Web&#8217;, will extend the Web&#8217;s capability through the increased availability machine-processable information. These machine-processable descriptions of Web information resources are called meta-data and are associated with ontologies, or conceptualisations of the domain of application. Meta-data and associated ontologies then allows more intelligent software systems to be written, automating the analysis and exploitation of Web-based information.
This paper describes how knowledge management can be improved through the adoption of Semantic Web technology. To realise this, a number of different technologies need to be brought together. Their fusion provides the infrastructure which makes semantic knowledge management possible. Specifically, the paper discusses the use of knowledge discovery and human language technology to (semi-)automatically derive the required ontologies and meta-data, along with a methodology to support this process. We describe techniques for management and controlled evolution of ontologies and a set of semantic knowledge access tools for enhanced information access. Finally, a set of application scenarios for the technology are sketched."

The methodology developed within the project guides the case studies for exploiting different ways for construction and usage of ontologies. However, because of the size of ontologies, their complexity, their formal underpinnings and the necessity to come towards a shared understanding within a group of people, ontologies are still far from being a commodity. In recent years, research aimed at paving the way for the construction of ontologies by ontology development environments. Thereby, we have seen different directions taken to support the engineering of ontologies. However, only few of these seminal approaches have worked towards combining all of these urgent desiderata. This observation seems to reflect our own project experience, viz. that it is far from trivial to offer a sound integration of these aspects. Therefore, OntoEdit is an ontology engineering environment that is rather unique in its kind as it combines methodology-based ontology development with capabilities for collaboration  and a tight integration into a tool framework, i.e. the On-To-Knowledge framework."
1811,"none","Developing software by selecting, adapting, combining, and integrating existing components instead of starting the system development process from scratch has become a key factor in economic software development. However, such a development process has to deal with four problems: First, components must be selected. Second, components must be adapted because they neither fit precisely the task that should be performed nor do they necessarily fit well to other selected components. Third, components must be combined and their interaction must be established. Fourth, it may be necessary to decompose complex problems into smaller subtasks for which components can be found. In this case, a general system frame must be established that enables to form an integrated system out of separate components. In this paper, we present our means to deal with these problems: brokers, adapters, connectors, and task structures. Although we discuss our approach in the context of problem-solving methods, some concepts are also applicable to software components in general."

1859,"none","Domains and metric spaces are two central tools for the study of denotational semantics in computer science, but are otherwise very different in many fundamental aspects. A construction that tries to establish links between both paradigms is the
space of formal balls, a continuous poset which can be defined for every metric space and that reflects many of its properties. On the other hand, in order to obtain a broader framework for applications and possible connections to domain theory, generalized ultrametric spaces (gums) have been introduced. In this paper, we employ the space of formal balls as a tool for studying these more general metrics by using
concepts and results from domain theory. It turns out that many properties of the
metric can be characterized via its formal-ball space. Furthermore, we can state new results on the topology of gums as well as two new fixed point theorems, which may be compared to the PrieÃŸ-Crampe and Ribenboim theorem, and the Banach fixed point theorem, respectively. Deeper insights into the nature of formal-ball spaces are gained by applying methods from category theory. Our results suggest that, while
being a useful tool for the study of gums, the space of formal balls does not provide the hoped-for general connection to domain theory."

1873,"none","Due to the fast growth of internet based electronic business activities, languages for modeling as well as methods for analyzing and executing distributed business processes are becoming more and more important. Efficient inter-organizational business processes in the field of e-commerce require the integration of electronic document interchange and inter-organizational process management. We propose to support inter-organizational business processes by so-called XML nets, a new variant of high-level Petri nets. XML nets are a formal, graphical modeling language that allows to model both the flow of XML documents and the control flow of the underlying business process. XML nets are based on GXSL, a novel graphical XML schema definition language, and its related graphical XML document manipulation language XManiLa. They can be directly executed by a respective workflow engine. Advantage of the formal foundation of XML nets can be taken, e.g., when analyzing a (global) inter-organizational workflow model. XML nets support the identification of relevant process fragments and their allocation to the appropriate organizational units. Thus XML nets help to derive an improved, process-oriented organizational structure."

Bei der Nutzung dieser Methoden ist jedoch &amp;#8211; insbesondere bei komplizierten Simulationen &amp;#8211; mit sehr langen Berechnungszeiten zu rechnen.

Characteristic of such systems are a complex knowledge base and an inference engine which uses this knowledge to solve a given problem. Languages for kbs have to cover both these aspects. They have to provide a means to specify a complex and large amount of knowledge and they have to provide means to specify the dynamic reasoning behavior of a kbs. Nethertheless, kbs are just a specific type of software systems. Therefore it seems quite natural to compare formal languages for specifying kbs with formal languages which were developed by the software engineering community for specifying software systems. That is the subject of this paper."

1882,"none","Dynamically and partially reconfiguranle field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) allow to swap in and out tasks without interrupting the execution of other tasks. The FPGA controller can decide on-line where to place new tasks onto the FPGA. Rearranging a subset of the tasks executing on the FPGA may allow the next pending task to be processed sooner. When tasks are rearranged, the arriving input data have to be buffered while the execution is suspended. In this paper, we describe and evaluate an evolutionary approach to solve the problem of placing and rearranging tasks that are supplied by input streams which have constant data rates. We use two genetic algorithms (GAs): one for iodentifying feasible rearrangements and the other for scheduling a selected rearrangement so that the delay caused by this rearrangement is small and the limited input buffer size is respected."

years, due mainly to the fact that increased scheduling
flexibility as well as tool support can now be offered at a widely
affordable level. As a result, many e-learning platforms and
systems have been developed and commercialized; these are based on
client-server, peer-to-peer, or, more recently, Web service
architectures, with a major drawback being their limitations in
scalability, availability, and distribution of computing power as
well as storage capabilities. This paper tries to remedy this
situation by proposing the use of grid computing in the context of
e-learning. In particular, it is shown what advantages a
utilization of grid computing may have to offer and which
applications could benefit from it. Moreover, an architecture for
an e-learning grid is outlined, and the notion of a grid

selection pressure. Assuming that fitness can be split up into an

2069,"none","Finding right information in the right moment is quite a tedious task on the Web. The main difficulty is the wrong context in which information is found and, therefore, part of the problem lies in the process of providing metadata about information resources on the web.  In other words, only by searching for keywords, which are assigned to the content of an information resource, a machine agent cannot differ between various contexts of using these keywords, and some non-relevant resources will be retrieved as the result of the searching process.   
In this paper, we propose a method for improving the annotation of information resources â€“ by forming conditional statements about keywords used in the describing content of a resource. This kind of annotation leads to the better precision of the information retrieval process â€“ by expressing the context of searching in a more precise manner. Moreover, such more expressive form of describing content of information resources supports a more powerful knowledge sharing process enabling the discovery of new information by considering the combination of existing information resources. In that way, the system provides some answers which are not explicitly stated in the information repository.
We present a knowledge management framework which implements such type of annotation and give a small evaluation study. The framework is based on using Semantic Web tools, which are developed at our Institute."

2080,"none","Following the tradition of workshops on application of Machine Learning that took place last years, this year a combined ICML/AAAI 98 workshop took place in Madison, Wisconsin. Where the ICML-97 workshop was focussed on real applications, this years workshop sought to proceed along these lines and extend the focus to the structure behind such applications. Questions where raised like: is there a possibility to find such structures, if so, which general structure can be found and how can they be described? Does our knowledge of structure in application processes aim us at new topics? Which topics should be raised, or are important? The one-days workshop program finally consisted of 8 accepted papers of which 7 where actually presented, and a total of 4 invited speakers let their lights shine on several topics concerning the process of application of ML. At the end of the day there was a discussion session that reflected on issues that rose during the presentations (which meant a slight change of program as it was originally defined)."

2082,"none","For many real-world optimization problems, the robustness of a solution is of great importance in addition to the solution's quality. By robustness, we mean that small deviations from the original design, e.g., due to manufacturing tolerances, should be tolerated without a severe loss of quality. One way to achieve that goal is to evaluate each solution under a number of different scenarios, and use the average solution quality as fitness. However, this approach is often impractical, because the cost for evaluating each individual several times is unacceptable. In this paper, we present a new and efficient approach to estimating a solution's expected quality and variance. Basically, we propose to construct local approximate models of the fitness function, and then use these approximate models to estimate expected fitness and variance. Based on a variety of test function, we demonstrate empirically that our approach significantly outperforms the implicit averaging approach as well as the explicit averaging approaches using existing estimation techniques reported in the literature."

2086,"none","Formal Concept Analysis is an unsupervised learning technique for conceptual clustering. We introduce the notion of iceberg concept lattices and show their use in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). Iceberg lattices are designed for analyzing very large databases. In particular they serve as a
condensed representation of frequent patterns as known from association rule mining.
In order to show the interplay between Formal Concept Analysis and association rule mining, we discuss the algorithm Titanic. We show that iceberg concept lattices are a starting point for
computing condensed sets of association rules without loss of information, and are a visualization method for the resulting rules."

field of lattice theory to a widely recognized tool in Computer Science
and elsewhere. In order to fully benefit from this theory, we believe that it
can be enriched with notions such as approximation by computation or representability. The latter are commonly studied in denotational semantics and domain theory and captured most prominently by the notion of algebraicity, e.g. of lattices. In this paper, we explore the notion of algebraicity in formal concept analysis from a category-theoretical perspective. To this end, we build on the the notion of approximable concept with a suitable category and show that the latter is equivalent to the category of algebraic lattices. At the same time, the paper provides a relatively comprehensive account of the representation theory of algebraic lattices in the framework of Stone duality, relating well-known structures such as Scott information systems with further formalisms from logic, topology, domains and lattice theory."

2164,"none","Galois connections between concept lattices can be represented as binary relations on the context level, known as dual bonds. The latter also appear as the elements of the tensor product of concept lattices, but it is known that not all dual bonds between two lattices can be represented in this way. In this work, we define <i>regular</i> Galois connections as those that are represented by a dual bond in a tensor product, and characterize them in terms of lattice theory. Regular Galois connections turn out to be much more common than irregular ones, and we identify many cases in which no irregular ones can be found at all. To this end, we demonstrate that irregularity of Galois connections on sublattices can be lifted to superlattices, and observe close relationships to various notions of distributivity. This is achieved by combining methods from algebraic order theory and FCA with recent results on dual bonds. Disjunctions in formal contexts play a prominent role in the proofs and add a logical flavor to our considerations. Hence it is not surprising that our studies allow us to derive corollaries on the contextual representation of deductive systems."

2284,"none","Horn-SHIQ has been identified as a fragment of the description logic SHIQ for which inferencing is in PTime with respect to the size of the ABox. This enables reasoning with larger ABoxes in situations where the TBox is static, and represents one approach towards tractable description logic reasoning. 


In this paper, we show that reasoning in Horn-SHIQ, in spite of its low data-complexity, is ExpTime-hard with respect to the overall size of the knowledge base. While this result is not unexpected, the proof is not a mere modification of existing reductions since it has to account for the restrictions of Hornness. We establish the result for Horn-FLE, showing that Hornness does not simplify TBox reasoning even for very restricted description logics. Moreover, we derive a context-free grammar that defines Horn-SHIQ in a simpler and more intuitive way than existing characterisations."

2367,"none","Identifying and presenting useful information for a given context is an important challenge for research and development of Web technologies.Providing access to information for humans and machines is one of the main motivations for the Semantic Web. Our contribution to the 2003 Semantic Web Grand Challenge realizes semantic-based search and access facilities to information represented by semantic portals. Such portals typically provide knowledge about a specific domain and rely on ontologies to structure and exchange this knowledge. Computer science exploits ontologies to enhance knowledge sharing and reuse. First, ontologies provide a common, shared understanding of knowledge in an interest domain. Second, they capture and formalize knowledge by connecting human understanding of symbols with their machine processability. As such, ontologies play a key role for realizing the Semantic Web.
Our contribution extends and implements the basic conceptual framework SEAL (SEmantic portAL) with the aim of using semantic technologies in real-world scenarios through a reliable, scalable infrastructure. We also show how multiple semantic portals can interact with one another to exchange knowledge, thus fostering reuse. The building blocks of our extension include knowledge integration, processing, representation, organization, and access. Our approach has these benefits: (i) Significant reduction of content maintenance overhead, (ii) knowledge accessibility for both human and machine agents, atop existing information sources, and (iii) suitability for productive environments."

roles and have equal capabilities. From the service perspective,
peers provide a single service. For this reason, there is no need
to explicitly model services. We argue, that for knowledge sharing
systems, we need   an effective combination of the capabilities of
the peers both in terms of the services as well as the content
they provide. In this paper we present an approach for modeling
peers with content and service capability descriptions that allows
a decentralized discovery and selection of peers. We show
instantiations for various kinds of bibliographic services that
are realized in the Bibster system, a semantics-based Peer-to-Peer

2383,"none","In [Hitzler and Wendt 2002, 2005], a new methodology has been proposed which allows to derive uniform characterizations of different declarative semantic
for logic programs with negation. One result from this work is that the
well-founded semantics can formally be understood as a stratified version
of the Fitting (or Kripke-Kleene) semantics. The constructions leading
to this result, however, show a certain asymmetry which is not readily
understood. We will study this situation here with the result that we
will obtain a coherent picture of relations between different semantics
for normal logic programs."
2384,"none","In [Tane 2005], we introduced the query-based multicontext theory,
which allows to define a virtual space of views on ontological data. Each
view is then materialised as a formal context. While this formal context
can be visualised in a usual formal concept analysis framework such as
Conexp or ToscanaJ, [Tane 2005] also briefly described how the approach allowed
the creation of a novel navigation framework for knowledge bases. The
principle of this navigation is based on supporting the user in defining
pertinent views. The purpose of this article is to discuss the benefits of
the browsing interface. This discussion is performed, on the one hand,
by comparing the approach to other Formal Concept Analysis based
frameworks. On the other hand, it exposes the preliminary evaluation of
the visualisation of formal contexts by comparing the display of a lattice
to two other approaches based on trees and graphs."

of common knowledge structures. These Conceptual Data Structures (CDS) were found to be inherent to a variety of different knowledge
artefacts ranging from vague paper notes to highly structured documents. CDS is
suitable for representing knowledge in various degrees of formalisation a uniform fashion,
allowing gradual migration.

CDS serves two purposes: First, as a guideline for future Personal
Knowledge Management (PKM) tools, providing a set of crucial structural
primitives.
Second, the RDF-based representation of CDS can serve as a knowledge exchange
format. It is capable of representing also vague or even inconsistent knowledge structures between people and PKM tools without unnecessary loss of

In order to get a global picture of the behavior of a customer, his single transactions have to be composed together. In On-Line Analytical Processing, this operation is known as reverse pivoting. With the ongoing data analysis process, reverse pivoting has to be repeated several times, usually requir- ing an implementation in SQL. In this paper, we present a construction for conceptual scales for reverse pivoting in Conceptual Information Sys- tems, and also discuss the visualization. The construction allows the reuse of previously created queries without reprogramming and offers a visualization of the results by line diagrams."

MIKE, our knowledge engineering framework, provides three basic means for structuring which are described in this paper: different kinds of knowledge are separated at different knowledge layers, knowledge layers can be structured by modules, and knowledge within modules is expressed in terms of an object-centred data model. In addition, ideas from entity relationship model clustering are adapted and extended to facilitate the understandability of domain knowledge and support the formation of modules."

2395,"none","In recent years two main technologies for knowledge sharing and reuse have emerged: ontologies and problem solving methods (PSMs). Ontologies specify reusable conceptualizations which can be shared by multiple reasoning components communicating during a problem solving process. PSMs describe in a domain-independent way the generic reasoning steps and knowledge types needed to perform a task. Typically PSMs are specified in a task-specific fashion, using modelling frameworks which describe their control and inference structures as well as their knowledge requirements and competence. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to PSM specification, which is based on the use of formal ontologies. In particular our specifications abstract from control, data flow and other dynamic aspects of PSMs to focus on the logical theory associated with a PSM (method ontology). This approach concentrates on the competence and knowledge requirements of a PSM, rather than internal control details, thus enabling black-box-style reuse. In the paper we also look at the nature of PSM specifications and we show that these can be characterised in a task-independent style as generic search strategies. The resulting ""modelling gap"" between method-independent task specifications and task-independent method ontologies can be bridged by constructing the relevant adapter ontology, which reformulates the method ontology in task-specific terms. An important aspect of the ontology-centred approach described here is that, in contrast with other characterisations of task-independent PSMs, it does away with the simple, binary distinction between weak and strong methods. We argue that any method can be defined in either task-independent or task-dependent style and therefore such distinction is of limited utility in PSM reuse. The differences between PSMs which affect reuse concern the ontological commitments which they make with respect to domain knowledge and goal specifications."

data of products into product groups, which offers organizational
advantages for example when new branches are opened, because they

by this approach, this paper focuses on business processes and
proposes the usage of workflow modules stored in a workflow
warehouse, which represent reusable, standardized components that
are used to build more complex workflow models. In particular, the
paper provides a formal foundation for such compositions in form
of a workflow algebra based on Petri nets, which has similar
operators known from relational algebra in databases. In addition,
the need for a concept of workflow normalization is presented,
which arises during the composition of workflow modules. Finally,
it is shown how the algebra can also be applied in the context of

They proved especially useful to capture unwanted changes and side effects during the maintenance of a program, and they grow with the evolution of the program.

Ontologies behave quite differently than program units. As there is no information hiding in ontology engineering, and thus no black box components, at first the idea of unit testing for ontologies seems not applicable.

In this paper we motivate the need for unit testing, describe the adaptation to the unit testing approach, and give use cases and examples."

Currently the semantic web attracts researchers from all around the world. Numerous tools and applications of semantic web technologies are already available and the number is growing fast. However, deploying large scale ontology solutions typically involves several separate tasks and requires applying multiple tools. Therefore pragmatic issues such as interoperability are key if industry is to be encouraged to take up ontology technology rapidly. The main aim of this workshop is therefore to encourage and stimulate discussions about the evaluation of ontology-based tools. 
The large visibility of the semantic web, itâ€™s tools and applications already attracts industrial partners, e.g. in numerous projects funded by the European Commission. In particular, as tools move from academic institutions into commercial environments they have to fulfil stronger requirements and in some cases new requirements (e.g. concerning scalability and multi-user access). Different tools from different sources need to interoperate. Typically tools are not anymore standalone solutions but integrated into a framework. This framework must be open to other commercial applications and provide connectors and interfaces to industrial standards. Larger applications need also larger ontologies and therefore require substantially more performance and scalability. 
A systematic evaluation of the tools might lead to a consistent level of quality and thus acceptance by industry. For the future this might lead into certification efforts for such tools."

2402,"none","In the field of Knowledge Engineering, dissatisfaction with the rapid-prototyping approach has led to a number of more principled methodologies for the construction of knowledge-based systems. Instead of immediately implementing the gathered and interpreted knowledge in a given implementation formalism according to the rapid-prototyping approach, many such methodologies centre around the notion of a conceptual model: an abstract, implementation independent description of the relevant problem solving expertise. A conceptual model should describe the task which is solved by the system and the knowledge which is required by it. Although such conceptual models have often been formulated in an informal way, recent years have seen the advent of formal and operational languages to describe such conceptual models more precisely, and operationally as a means for model evaluation. In this paper, we study a number of such formal and operational languages for specifying conceptual models. In order to enable a meaningful comparison of such languages, we focus on languages which are all aimed at the same underlying conceptual model, namely that from the KADS method for building KBS. We describe eight formal languages for KADS models of expertise, and compare these languages with respect to their modelling primitives, their semantics, their implementations and their applications. Future research issues in the area of formal and operational specification languages for KBS are identified as the result of studying these languages. The paper also contains an extensive bibliography of research in this area."
2403,"none","In the last years a common notion of a Problem-Solving Method (PSM) emerged from different knowledge engineering frameworks. As a generic description of the dynamic behaviour of knowledge based systems PSMs are favored subjects of reuse. Up to now, most investigations on the reuse of PSMs focus on static features and methods as objects of reuse. By this, they ignore a lot of information of how the PSM was developed that is, in principle, entailed in the different parts of a conceptual model of a PSM. In this paper the information of the different parts of PSMs is reconsidered from a reuse process point of view. A framework for generalized problem-solving methods is presented that describes the structure of a category of methods based on family resemblances. These generalized methods can be used to structure libraries of PSMs and - in the process of reuse - as a means to derive an incarnation, i.e. a member of its family of PSMs. For illustrating the ideas, the approach is applied to the task rsp. problem type of parametric design."

Judges had a strong and thorough education and became experts in their domain, but they still often seek the help of senior judges or tutors to solve on-duty problems. The knowledge acquisition process has been based on an ethnographic process designed by the UAB team and the Spanish School of the Judiciary within the national SEC project,  to efficiently obtain useful and representative information from questionnaire-based interviews. Nearly 800 competency questions have been extracted from these interviews and the ontology is being modelled from the selection of relevant terms. Once the terms are identified, the relevant relations between those terms need also to be identified, following a middle-out strategy.

Regarding ontology modelling issues, some other changes have been introduced into Iuriservice prototype II. First, several KAON applications, such as the ontology editor Oi- Modeler, have been used in order to model and visualize the domain ontology. Second, we have used two different software applications to analyze the competency questions and extract relevant concepts: TextToOnto and ALCESTE.

As a result, more and more appliances surrounding us are equipped with embedded computational power and wireless communication. As such, they become ever more flexible and multifunctional, and almost indispensable in daily life. On the other hand, the resulting systems become increasingly complex and unreliable, posing new challenges to designer and user.
Organic Computing (OC) has the vision to address the challenges of complex distributed systems by making them more life-like (organic), i.e. endowing them with abilities such as self-organization, self-configuration, self-repair, or adaptation. The designer's task is simplified, because it is no longer necessary to exactly specify the low-level system behavior in all possible situations that might occur, but instead leaving the system with a certain degree of freedom which allows it to react in an intelligent way to new situations. Also, use of such systems is simplified, as they can be controlled by setting few high-level goals, rather than having to manipulate many low-level parameters with unclear influence.
In this paper, we give a general introduction to OC, and propose a generic observer-controller architecture as a framework for designing OC systems. Then, it is shown how to use this architecture at the example of a traffic light controller. The paper concludes with a summary and a discussion of future challenges."

Former EON workshops aimed at evaluating ontology-based tools, the this year's workshop focuses on the Evaluation of Ontologies (content, usability, etc.) themselves. Whereas some effort already was invested in reusing work from related research areas towards the end of Ontology Evaluation, often the basic premises of the web-like environment are forgotten or disregarded. Thus the main goal of this workshop is to lay the foundations for Web Ontology Evaluation.

Ontologies now play an important role for many knowledge-intensive applications for which they provide a source of formally defined terms. They aim at capturing domain knowledge in a generic way and provide a commonly agreed understanding of a domain, which may be reused, shared, and operationalized across applications and groups. Numerous ontologies are already available and the number is growing rapidly. Still a well understood definition or even intuition about qualities that apply to ontologies is lacking. The large visibility of the Semantic Web already attracts industrial partners. Ontology-based tools depend more and more on the explicit knowledge captured in ontologies. A well-understood notion of Ontology Evaluation might lead to a consistent level of quality and thus acceptance by industry. For the future this might lead to certification efforts for such ontologies.

The aim of this workshop is to ground Ontology Evaluation firmly on the needs of the Semantic Web, especially regarding its web-like characteristics like high interconnectivity, constant change and incompleteness. We will focus on the Semantic Web languages as standardized or proposed by the W3C: RDF(S), OWL and the rule language. We want to encourage and stimulate discussion about the current state of the art in Ontology Evaluation and its future direction.

Thereby, we and that levels of granularity play a major role for applying these techniques in our more expressive framework.

reside on the remote peers, and only the parts relevant for
answering the query need to be retrieved to the local node.

answering is essentially dominated by the size of the data, and only
slightly affected by the degree of distribution and heterogeneity."

Three main features distinguish Text2Onto from our earlier framework TextToOnto as well as other state-of-the-art ontology learning frameworks. First, by representing the learned knowledge at a meta-level in the form of instantiated modeling primitives within a so called Probabilistic Ontology Model (POM), we remain independent of a concrete target language while being able to translate the instantiated primitives into any (reasonably expressive) knowledge representation formalism. Second, user interaction is a core aspect of Text2Onto and the fact that the system calculates a confidence for each learned object allows to design sophisticated visualizations of the POM. Third, by incorporating strategies for data-driven change discovery, we avoid processing the whole corpus from scratch each time it changes, only selectively updating the POM according to the corpus changes instead. Besides increasing efficiency in this way, it also allows a user to trace the evolution of the ontology with respect to the changes in the underlying corpus."
2422,"none","In this paper we present a new approach for language-neutral modeling of large-scale ontologies. The gist of our approach lies in the way we treat the majority of axioms. Instead of capturing axiom semantics in some specific representation language, we categorize axioms into different types and specify them as complex objects that refer to concepts and relations. A separate layer that is language-specific, in fact it may even vary for different inference engines working on the same language, describes how these objects are translated into a goal representation. In addition to its far reaching independence with regard to specific representation languages, this approach benefits engineering since the semantics of important types of axioms may be much more elucidated in our ontology engineering tool, OntoEdit, than in comparable tools. Furthermore, our approach is principled in a way that allows for comparably easy adaptation of our tool to requirements for modeling axioms in specific domains."

The approach is based on generating a lattice of the refinements, that enables a step-by-step tailoring of a query to the current information needs of a user. These needs are implicitly elicited by analysing the user&#8217;s behaviour during the searching process. The gap between a user&#8217;s need and his query is quantified by measuring several types of query ambiguities, that are used for ranking of the refinements. The main advantage of the approach is a more cooperative support in the refinement process: by exploiting the ontology background, the approach supports finding &#8220;similar&#8221; results and enables efficient relaxing of failing queries. Regarding an evaluation study, we discuss how a traditional on-line product catalog application can benefit from employing more formal, machine-readable semantics for describing its content, thus integrating such a catalog into the Semantic Web."
2427,"none","In this paper we present an approach for the query refinement called Librarian Agent Query Refinement Process, which simulates the role a human librarian plays in the searching for information resources in a library. The process consists of two phases: Problem Discovery, in which the potential problems (ambiguities) of the initial query are discovered and estimated and Query Refinement, which analyses these ambiguities in order to provide suitable modification of that query that increases the precision and recall of the searching process. The Agent performs comprehensive analyses of a query, based on the structure of the used vocabulary in an information portal and the content of its information repository. Moreover, the information about the previous usersâ€™ behaviour and the activities of the current user are used for making the query refinement process more efficient (i.e. usage-driven and personalized). From the userâ€™s point of view, the main advantage of such an approach is that it enables a user to satisfy his information need in a more intuitive and efficient way."
2428,"none","In this paper we present an approach that models the behaviour of an on-line shop assistant on the knowledge level, i.e. it takes into account not only which actions (questions) a shop assistant will perform, but also which goals he wants to achieve by taking an action. As a generic reasoning pattern of such an e-shop agent we use the cover-and-differentiate problem-solving method, a method very successfully applied in various diagnosis and classification tasks. In that way, we can (i) model the question-answering process such that the minimal set of useful questions will be provided to a user, (ii) easily reinterpret and fine-tune shopping strategies that exist in other e-shop portals and (iii) design and integrate new methods into generic reasoning pattern. We present an evaluation study which illustrates these benefits."
2429,"none","In this paper we present an approach to model ontology evolution as reconfiguration-design problem solving. The problem is reduced to a graph search where the nodes are evolving ontologies and the edges represent the changes that transform the source node into the target node. The search is guided by the constraints provided partially by a user and partially by a set of rules defining ontology consistency. In this way we allow a user to specify an arbitrary request declaratively and ensure its resolving. The approach is implemented in the KAON framework and the evaluation study shows its benefits."
2430,"none","In this paper we present an ontology based approach for dynamic integration
of business partners on demand. ODAMY, an ontology-based methodology, is
proposed allowing flexible partner integration on demand into existing or

and select business partners. It provides required mechanisms and methods to support trust building by supporting communication and increases
transparency within the network. Network companies are represented by a kind
of &amp;#8220;fingerprint&amp;#8221; describing their co-operation ability and requirements. First, the paper introduces into the scenario of dynamic business ecosystems. Then developments, trends and requirements of existing b2b integration concepts are discussed.

2431,"none","In this paper we present the conceptual architecture of ONTOLOGER, a system for usage-driven management of querying for information in ontology-based information portals. The system is based on the analysis of usersâ€™ activities that are acquired in the so-called semantic log file, which contains information about the content of a visited page as well. These analyses are used for managing (i) the underlying ontology, (ii) querying mechanism and (iii) the content of the information repository, in order to ensure that (a) the structure of the vocabulary reflects the needs of users, (b) the highly-relevant results can be found by users although they make short queries and read only top-ranked results and (c) the information repository contains (only) resources users are interested in. The focus of the paper is on improving querying (retrieval) mechanism based on the usage data. We present a case study, which shows how a portal can benefit from implementing presented management system."

2434,"none","In this paper we present the language G-KARL. G-KARL allows to describe the static, the functional and the dynamic view to a knowledge based system (kbs) graphically. This graphical representation makes the communication between the expert and the knowledge engineer easier. The underlying conceptual model for G-KARL is derived from the KADS model of expertise. Every primitive of G-KARL may be mapped to a language primitive of the language KARL (Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language). KARL is a formal language, so every primitive of G-KARL has a defined formal semantics. KARL is an executable language, so G-KARL is also executable which supports the validation of the model of expertise by testing and thus allows the model of expertise to be built by prototyping. G-KARL allows to visualize the execution of this model which additionally supports the validation process. While G-KARL contains well established graphical means for the different views like the OMT-notation for the static view, data flow diagrams for the functional view and program flow diagrams for the dynamic view, G-KARL also offers new graphical primitives for specifying elementary inference actions within data flow diagrams and for specifying sufficient and necessary conditions within the static view. In KARL these model elements are described by L-KARL, a logical language enriched by additional modeling primitives."
2435,"none","In this paper we presented a framework for the query refinement which is driven by the userâ€™s information needs. Based on the analyses of the real IR case studies we gathered the requirements and modeled the query refinement process as the process of changing query ambiguity according to a user â€˜s need. We define several semantic and structural ambiguities, implied by the used vocabulary and information repository, respectively. As our evaluation study shows, the usability of the approach overcomes the traditional information retrieval problems and enables the realisation of an e-shop-assistant in the e-commerce applications."

these ontologies. The comparison result shows limitations of
existing formalisms to fully address the need of modular ontologies

those limitations."
2437,"none","In this paper, we describe a solution to the Sisyphus elevator configuration problem by combining the formal and operational specification language KARL and the configurable role-limiting shell approach. The knowledge is described in a graphical and semiformal manner which is influenced by the KADS models of expertise. A formal description is gained by supplementing the semiformal description with formal specifications which add a new level of precision and uniqueness. A role limiting shell for propose-and-revise systems was designed and implemented as realization of the final system. This shell has been derived by adapting another shell which is based on a similar problem-solving method, namely the propose-and-exchange method."
2438,"none","In this paper, we discuss Conceptual Knowledge Discovery in Databases (CKDD) in its connection with Data Analysis. Our approach is based on Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical theory which has been developed and proven useful during the last 20 years. Formal ConÂ­ cept Analysis has led to a theory of conceptual information systems which has been applied by using the management system TOSCANA in a wide range of domains. In this paper, we use such an application in database marketing to demonstrate how methods and procedures of CKDD can be applied in Data Analysis. In particular, we show the interplay and integration of data mining and data analysis techniques based on ForÂ­ mal Concept Analysis. The main concern of this paper is to explain how the transition from data to knowledge can be supported by a TOSCANA system. To clarify the transition steps we discuss their correspondence to the five levels of knowledge representation established by R. Brachman and to the steps of empirically grounded theory building proposed by A. Strauss and J. Corbin."
2439,"none","In this paper, we outline an approach for constructing clusters of related
terms that may be used for deriving formal conceptual structures like taxonomies. In contrast to previous approaches in this direction, we take into account the fact that words can have several meanings and consider two alternative soft clustering techniques, namely Overlapping Pole-Based Clustering (PoBOC) and Clustering by Comittees (CBC) for this purpose. These soft clustering algorithms try to detect
different contexts of the clustered words, resulting in possibly more than one cluster membership. We report on initial experiments conducted on textual data from the tourist domain."
2440,"none","In this paper, we present a novel approach for the change discovery in the ontology-based knowledge management systems. It extends our previous work in the ontology evolution by taking into account the usage of the ontology in the knowledge management system. The approach is mainly based on the analysis of the userâ€™s interaction with the system in providing annotations for knowledge resources, as well as in the process of accessing the knowledge by querying the knowledge repository. We defined several assessment criteria to estimate the quality of annotations and the userâ€™s needs from the point of view of the knowledge management. These criteria result in the recommendations for the continual system improvement. Two evaluation studies illustrate the benefits of our approach."
2441,"none","In this paper, we present a novel approach for the management of ontology-based knowledge portals. The approach is based on the analysis of the factors, which influence the precision of the searching for information. We focus on the structure of user queries, which are an estimation of the user information needs. Two kinds of analyses of the usersâ€™ queries are performed: static - related to the ontological properties and dynamic - related to the usersâ€™ interaction with the system. Regarding to the first analysis we define several assessment criteria for the quality of the metadata. For the second analysis, we introduced the Log ontology as a backbone for storing and analysing information about usersâ€™ behaviours in the Portal. We extended the previous research done in the analysing Query logs by introducing query-rewriting patterns. Moreover, we developed a new technology for tracking usersâ€™ interactions with the system, which is applied in our case study. The short evaluation shows the benefits of our approach in the real-world portals."

2443,"none","In this paper, we present an agent-based approach for the improvement of searching in an ontology-based knowledge management system. The system implements a library scenario in which users query the repository for knowledge resources. Consequently, the so-called Librarian Agent plays the role of the human librarian in the traditional library â€“ it uses all possible information, about the domain vocabulary, the behaviour of previous users and the capacity of the knowledge repository, in order to help users find the resources they are interested in. We partially implemented the approach in the Web Portal of our Institute and some initial evaluation results are shown."
2444,"none","In this paper, we present an approach for the disambiguation of ontology-based queries. The approach is based on measuring the ambiguity of a query with respect to the userâ€™s initial information need. We define several types of ambiguities concerning the structure of the underlying ontology and the content of the information repository. For each of these ambiguities we define a set of refinements/explanations, which helps in more efficient searching for information in an ontology-based information repository. We demonstrate the benefits of using our approach in an evaluation study."
2445,"none","In this paper, we propose an approach for guiding ontology managers through the modification of an ontology with respect to users' needs.

Several measures taking into account the ontology hierarchy are defined. Their application on the usage log results in the set of the recommendations for the ontology improvement. The approach has been implemented in the system called OntoManager. The evaluation study shows the benefits of supporting ontology management by our approach."
2446,"none","In this paper, we propose the algorithm Pascal which introduces a novel op- timization of the well-known algorithm Apriori. Being provided with a given minsup threshold, Pascal discovers all frequent patterns by performing as few counting as possible. In order to derive the support of larger patterns without accessing the database whenever it is possible, we use the knowledge about the support of some of their sub-patterns, the so-called key patterns. Experiments comparing Pascal to the three algorithms Apriori, Close and Max-Miner, each of which being representative of a frequent patterns discovery strategy, show that Pascal is the most eÃ†cient algorithm for extracting patterns from strongly correlated data. Moreover, its execution times are equivalent to those of Apriori and Max-Miner when data is weakly correlated."

Experiments comparing Pascal to the three algorithms Apriori, Close and Max-Miner, show that Pascal is among the most efficient algorithms for mining frequent patterns."

SmartWeb project, we have developed a number of domain-specific ontologies

open-domain question-answering and information services on the Web.
To integrate the various domain-specific ontologies, we have developed
a foundational ontology, the SmartSUMO ontology, on the basis of
the DOLCE and SUMO ontologies. This allows us to combine all
the developed ontologies into a single SmartWeb Integrated Ontology
SWIntO. In this paper, we present the SmartSUMO ontology, describe

Neither merging the information from different data sources nor
preparing it for the end user's access has been completely solved.
The goal of this paper is to present a holistic approach to
integration by using ontologies and logic. There are several
reasons for an ontology-based approach: Ontologies are able to
cover all occurring data structures, for ontologies can be seen as
nowadays most advanced knowledge representation model. They are
able to cover complexity, for the combination with deductive logic
extends the mapping and business logic capabilities. As the model
is separated from the data storage, we get a higher degree of
abstraction, whereby the semantics of the whole system is
increased. Ontologies are extendible and highly reusable and
deliver the user a better access to his relevant content.
In this paper we describe how current capabilities of knowledge
representation, mapping of structures and description of the
business logic are extended. In an elaborated case study of a
specific R&amp;D process in the automobile industry we demonstrate
that the complex integration process can be realized much easier,
faster, more understandable and less expensive than before,
without changing the existing IT legacy environment."

A visualized mapping tool is developed to facilitate domain experts in defining semantic mappings from heterogeneous relational schemas to the shared ontology. The query interface is dynamically generated based on class definitions, and able to rewrite SPARQL queries to a set of SQL queries. An intuitive search interface enables user to get more accurate and reliable search results based on a concepts ranking mechanism.

2747,"none","Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is currently a hot topic in industry and academia. Unfortunately, the focus of research behind most emerging products is on underlying algorithms and modelling techniques. The main bottleneck for KDD applications is not the lack of techniques. The challenge is to exploit and combine existing algorithms effectively. In this paper, we describe the project Citrus which addresses these practically relevant issues. Starting from a commercially available system, we develop a scalable, extensible tool inherently based on the view of KDD as an interactive and iterative process. In this paper we sketch the main components of this system, namely an information manager for effective retrieval of data and results, an execution server for efficient execution, and a process support interface for guiding the user through the process."

2750,"none","Knowledge Engineering (KE) and Software Engineering (SE) have similar goals: developing methods, techniques, and tools for the building process of either knowledge based systems (kbs) or (complex) traditional software. Due to this kinship it seems obvious to analyse to which extent both areas, KE and SE, can benefit from each other. In this paper we want to argue from the KE point of view. The main paradigm in KE has switched from a transfer point of view to a modeling point of view. So a lot of emphasis has been put on the development of notions and methods for building and structuring models, which capture different results of the development process. Much effort has been investigated into the analysis and development of reusable components: problem solving methods describing the dynamic behaviour of kbs and ontologies defining the vocabulary and structure of (domain) models. We describe specific approaches in KE in some detail which exploit these ideas in different ways: Role-Limiting Methods, KADS and MIKE. Finally Life Cycle Models, Non Functional Requirements and Transformational Development are discussed as areas where we think KE might profit from research and experiences made in SE."

2755,"none","Knowledge Engineering was in the past primarily concerned with building and developing knowledge-based systems, an objective which puts Knowledge Engineering in a niche of the world-wide research efforts - at best. This has changed dramatically: Knowledge Engineering is now a key technology in the upcoming knowledge society. Companies are recognizing knowledge as their key assets, which have to be exploited and protected in a fast changing, global and competitive economy. This situation has led to the application of Knowledge Engineering techniques in Knowledge Management. The demand for more efficient (business to) business processes requires the interconnection and interoperation of different information systems. But information access and integration is not an algorithmic task that is easy to solve: much knowledge is required to resolve the semantic differences of data residing in two information systems. Thus Knowledge Engineering has become a major technique for information integration. And, last but not least the fast growing World Wide Web generates an ever-increasing demand for more efficient knowledge exploitation and creation techniques. Here again Knowledge Engineering technologies may become the key technology for solving the problem. In this paper we discuss these recent developments and describe our view of the future."

2779,"none","Knowledge domains and their formal representations via ontologies are typically subject to change in practical applications. Additionally, engineering of ontologies often takes place in distributed settings where multiple independent users interact. Therefore, change management for ontologies becomes a crucial aspect for any kind of ontology management environment. This paper introduces a new RDF-centric versioning approach and an implementation called SemVersion. SemVersion provides structural and semantic versioning for RDF models and RDF-based ontology languages like RDFS."

2781,"none","Knowledge management solutions relying on central repositories sometime
have not met expectations, since users often create knowledge ad-hoc using their individual vocabulary and using their own decentral IT infrastructure (e.g., their laptop). To improve knowledge management for such decentralized and individualized
knowledge work, it is necessary to, first, provide a corresponding IT infrastructure and to, second, deal with the harmonization of different vocabularies/ontologies. In this paper, we briefly sketch the technical peer-to-peer platform that we have built, but then we focus on the harmonization of the participating
ontologies. Thereby, the objective of this harmonization is to avoid the worst incongruencies by having users share a core ontology that they can expand for local use at their will and individual needs. The task that then needs to be solved is one of distributed, loosely-controlled and evolving engineering of ontologies. In this paper we present a corresponding process template and a case study."
2782,"none","Knowledge portals provide views onto domain-specific information on the World Wide Web, thus facilitating their users to find relevant, domain-specific information. The construction of intelligent access and the provisioning of information to knowledge portals, however, remained an ad hoc task requiring extensive manual editing and maintenance by the knowledge portal providers. In order to diminish these efforts we use ontologies as a conceptual backbone for providing, accessing and structuring information in a comprehensive approach for building and maintaining knowledge portals. We present one research and one commercial case study that show how our approach is used in practice."
2783,"none","Knowledge representation and semantic annotation of multimedia documents typically have been pursued in two different directions. Previous approaches have focused either on low-level descriptors, such as dominant colour, or on the semantic content dimension and corresponding manual annotations, such as person or vehicle. Here, a knowledge infrastructure and an experimentation platform for semantic annotation to bridge the two directions are presented. Ontologies are being extended and enriched to include low-level audiovisual features and descriptors. Additionally, a tool that allows for linking low-level MPEG-7 visual descriptions to ontologies and annotations is presented. Thus, ontologies that include prototypical instances of high-level domain concepts together with a formal specification of the corresponding visual descriptors are constructed. This infrastructure is exploited by a knowledge-assisted analysis framework that may handle problems such as segmentation, tracking, feature extraction and matching in order to classify scenes, identify and label objects and thus automatically create the associated semantic metadata."
2784,"none","Knowledge representation using ontologies constitutes the heart of
semantic technologies. Despite successful standardization efforts by the W3C, however, there are still numerous different ontology representation
languages being used, and interoperability between them is in general not
given. The problem is aggrevated by the fact that current standards lay
foundations only and are well-known to be insufficient for the modelling of
finer details. Thus, a plethora of extensions of the basic languages is being proposed, rendering the picture of ontology representation languages to
be chaotic, to say the least. While semantic technologies start to become
applicable and are being applied in adjacent areas of research and in research projects with industrial participation, and can soon be expected
to become an integral part of industrial applications, the practitioner is
faced with the difficult task of choosing his basic ontology representation paradigm. We will argue that the OWL subset known as Description Logic Programs constitutes a very reasonable choice."
2785,"none","Knowledge sharing in a virtual organization requires a knowledge life cycle including knowledge provisioning, terminology alignment, determination of resource location, query routing, and query answering. In this talk we focus on the issue of determining a relevant resource in a completely decentralized setting such as necessitated by peer-to-peer knowledge management in virtual organizations. Requirements for this task include, e.g., full autonomy of peers as well as full control over own resources and therefore preclude prominent resource location and query routing schemes such as distributed hash tables. In order to tackle given requirements we use a resource location and query routing approach that exploits social metaphors of topical experts and experts&#8217; experts as well as semantic similarity of queries and information sources. The approach has been fully tested in simulation runs and partially implemented in the system Bibster (http://bibster.semanticweb.org)."

As in heterogenous communities users typically will use different parts of such an ontology with varying intensity, customization and personalization of the ontologies is desirable. Of particular interest for supporting users during the personalization are collaborative filtering systems which can produce personal recommendations by
computing the similarity between own preferences and the one of other people. In this paper we adapt a collaborative filtering recommender system to assist users in
the management and evolution of their personal ontology by providing detailed
suggestions of ontology changes. Such a system has been implemented in the
context of Bibster, a peer-to-peer based personal bibliography management tool. Finally, we report on an experiment with the Bibster community that shows the performance improvements over non-personalized recommendations."

exchange reusable granules of learning material between different
e-learning systems. A common problem encountered in practical
situations is that conceptually coherent learning material may be
distributed across several LOs, a problem which may originate in
the way the material is decomposed into LOs. From a maintenance
perspective, modifications and updates of such material are
tedious and expensive, since modifications may have to be done in
various locations in several LOs. This paper proposes to remedy
this problem by using solutions already established in the area of
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). Furthermore, it is shown from a
reengineering perspective how crosscutting concerns of LOs can be
modularized as aspects and how aspects can be linked with LOs

2843,"none","Learning from examples is a field of research in machine learning where class descriptions, like decision trees or implications (production rules or horn clauses) are produced using positive and negative examples as information. To solve this task many different heuristic search strategies have been developed, so far. The search by specialization is the most widely used search strategy, whereas other approaches use a search by generalization only. JoJo is an algorithm that combines both search directions into one search procedure. According to the estimated quality of the currently regarded rule either a generalization or specialization step is carried out by deleting or adding one premise to the conjunction part of the rule. But, to create an even more flexible (and faster) algorithm, it should be possible to delete or add more than just one premise at a time. Relaxing this restriction of JoJo led to the new highly flexible algorithm Frog that additionally uses a third search direction."

the web. Naturally, it is desirable to investigate the interoperability
between both paradigms. In this paper, we do so
by studying an expressive fragement of OWL DL for which
reasoning can be reduced to the evaluation of Horn logic
programs. Building on the KAON2 algorithms for transforming
OWL DL into disjunctive Datalog, we give a detailed
account of how and to what extent OWL DL can be
employed in standard logic programming systems. En route,
we derive a novel, simplified characterization of the supported
fragment of OWL DL."

2940,"none","Many real-world optimization problems involve multiple, typically
conflicting objectives.  Often, it is very difficult to weigh the
different criteria exactly before alternatives are known. Evolutionary
multi-objective optimization usually solves this predicament by
searching for the whole Pareto-optimal front of solutions. However,
often the user has at least a vague idea about what kind of solutions might
be preferred. In this chapter, we argue that such knowledge should
be used to focus the search on the most interesting (from a user's perspective)
areas of the Pareto-optimal front. To this end, we present and compare
two methods which allow to integrate vague user preferences into
evolutionary multi-objective algorithms.
As we show, such methods may speed up the
search and yield a more fine-grained selection of alternatives in the most relevant
parts of the Pareto-optimal front."
2941,"none","Many real-world problems are dynamic, requiring an optimization algorithm which is able to continuously track a changing optimum over time.  In this paper, we explore new variants of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) specifically designed to work well in dynamic environments. The main idea is to split the population of particles into a set of interacting swarms. These swarms interact locally by an exclusion parameter and globally through a new anti-convergence operator. In addition, each swarm maintains diversity either by using charged or quantum particles. The paper derives guidelines for setting the involved parameters and evaluates the multi-swarm algorithms on a variety of instances of the multi-modal dynamic moving peaks benchmark. Results are also compared to other PSO and evolutionary algorithm approaches from the literature, showing that the new multi-swarm optimizer significantly outperforms previous approaches."
2942,"none","Mapping of ontologies generalizes a number of problems occurring in realistic semantic
web applications such as the following ones: (I) Data integration is concerned with the use of data from different sources in one application. The data from the different sources needs to be presented to the user in a
unified way. Typical scenarios include (a) the integration of relational databases into semantic
web applications, where database schemas are first &amp;#8220;lifted&amp;#8221; to the ontology level
and then mapped to the ontologies of the applications, and (b) the usage of different
heterogeneous ontologies within semantic web applications (e.g. by reusing different
domain ontologies).
(II) Ontology evolution deals with the fact that in reality ontologies are typically not
static entities but they rather evolve over time. This holds also for ontologies which participate
in mappings to other ontologies. Therefore one can further distinguish between
(a) evolving ontology mappings, (b) mapping different versions of multiple evolving
ontology, and (c) mapping between versions of one ontology.
To handle the increasing number of individual ontologies, but also for being able to
create mappings on the fly, it becomes necessary to develop automatic approaches. In
this paper, we determine mappings based on the similarity of the features of individual
ontological entities. We show that mappings can be derived automatically and on the
fly by encoding similarities into logical axioms and processing them with an inference
engine. The advantages of this approach are obvious. Firstly, the axioms can easily be
reused for mappings of arbitrary ontologies, no additional modeling effort is required.
Secondly, the inference engine is the only mandatory technological infrastructure which
means that no additional implementation effort is needed."

3093,"none","Most papers in model-based diagnosis and most papers in knowledge engineering on problem-solving methods focus on the description of reasoning strategies and discuss their underlying assumptions as a side-aspect. We take a complementary point of view by focusing on these underlying assumptions as these assumptions play an important role: They are necessary to characterise the precise competence of a problem-solving method in terms of the tasks that can be solved by it and in terms of the domain knowledge that is required by it. They are necessary to enable tractable problem solving for complex problems. Their introduction and the refinement of existing assumptions can be used to develop new problem-solving methods or to adapt existing ones according to task and domain-specific circumstances of a given application. For this purpose, one require a framework for dealing with these assumptions. The paper makes a step in this direction by summarizing the assumptions that can be found in the literature on component-based diagnosis. The main contribution of the paper is to collect these assumptions, to make their role for the reasoning process explicit, and to systematize these assumptions by making explicit their relationships."

3102,"none","Multidimensional dynamic logic programs are a paradigm
which allows to express (partially) hierarchically ordered evolving knowledge
bases through (partially) ordered multi sets of logic programs and
allowing to solve contradictions among rules in different programs by allowing
rules in more important programs to reject rules in less important
ones. This class of programs extends the class of dynamic logic program
that provides meaning and semantics to sequences of logic programs. Recently
a semantics named refined stable model semantics has fixed some
counterintuitive behaviour of previously existing semantics for dynamic
logic programs. However, it is not possible to directly extend the definitions
and concepts of the refined semantics to the multidimensional
case and hence more sophisticated principles and techniques are in order.
In this paper we face the problem of defining a proper semantics
for multidimensional dynamic logic programs by extending the idea of
well supported model to this class of programs and by showing that this
concept alone is enough for univocally characterizing a proper semantics.
We then show how the newly defined semantics coincides with the
refined one when applied to sequences of programs."

It is a formal language with a well-defined semantics and thus allows to represent PSMs precisely and unambiguously yet abstracting from implementation detail. In this paper it is shown how the language KARL has been modified and extended to New KARL to better meet the needs for the representation of PSMs. Based on a conceptual structure of PSMs new language primitives are introduced for KARL to specify such a conceptual structure and to support the configuration of methods. An important goal for this extension was to preserve three important properties of KARL: to be (i) a conceptual, (ii) a formal, and (iii) an executable language."

3239,"none","One of the core challenges for the Semantic Web is the aspect of decentralization. Local structures can be modeled by ontologies. How- ever, in order to support global communication and knowledge exchange, mechanisms have to be developed for integrating the local systems. We adopt the database approach of autonomous federated database systems and consider an architecture for federated ontologies for the Semantic Web as starting point of our work. We identify the need for merging specific ontologies for developing feder- ated, but still autonomous web systems. We present the method FCA{ Merge for merging ontologies following a bottom-up approach which offers a structural description of the merging process. The method is guided by application-specific instances of the given source ontologies that are to be merged. We apply techniques from natural language pro- cessing and formal concept analysis to derive a lattice of concepts as a structural result of FCA{Merge. The generated result is then explored and transformed into the merged ontology with human interaction."
3240,"none","One of the main problems in the (web) information retrieval is the ambiguity of the usersâ€™ queries, since the users tend to post very short queries. This seems to be valid for the ontology-based information retrieval in which the domain ontology is used as the backbone of the searching process. In this paper we present a novel approach for determining the possible refinements of an ontology-based query. The approach is based on measuring the ambiguity of a query with respect to the original user information need. We defined several types of the ambiguities concerning the structure of the underlying ontology and the content of the information repository. For each of these ambiguities we defined the set of refinements/explanations, which help in more efficient searching for information in an ontology-based information repository."
3241,"none","One of the main strengths of an ontology-based system is the intensional description of the knowledge (information) about a domain, which is used in an inferencing process as a means of implying new domain knowledge. This inferencing process is very efficiently used for the explanation how an answer to a userâ€™s query was derived, increasing the trust of a user in the answers of the query. Moreover, such a derivation tree can be treated as an evidence of the relevance of an answer for the userâ€™s query. In this paper we present an approach which combines the derivation tree with the factual information in order to support the ranking of the results of an ontology-based query. Moreover, we discuss the possibilities to use such a ranking for clustering queryâ€™s results. The approach has been implemented in the Ontobroker system, a main memory deductive database system."
3242,"none","One of the major problems of large scale, distributed and evolving ontologies

four different approaches to handling inconsistency in DL-based ontologies: consistent
ontology evolution, repairing inconsistencies, reasoning in the presence of
inconsistencies and multi-version reasoning. We present a common formal basis
for all of them, and use this common basis to compare these approaches. We
discuss the different requirements for each of these methods, the conditions under
which each of them is applicable, the knowledge requirements of the various
methods, and the different usage scenarios to which they would apply."
3243,"none","One of the vital problems in the searching for information is the ranking of the retrieved results, because users make typically very short queries (2-3 terms) and tend to consider only the first ten results. In traditional IR approaches the relevance of the results is determined only by analysing the underlying information repository (content and hyperlink structure), which leads to the weak relevance model. On the other hand, in the Semantic Web the querying process is supported by an ontology such that other important sources for determining the relevance of results can be considered: the structure of the underlying domain and the characteristics of the searching process.
In this paper we present a novel approach for determining relevance in ontology-based searching for information, which exploits the â€œfull potentialâ€ of the semantics of such a semantically-based link structure. We present several analyses about how a Semantic Web querying mechanism can benefit of using our ranking approach."

Although it is well documented in numerous publications, and its importance

to the high costs for applying OntoClean, especially on tagging concepts
with the correct meta-properties. In order to facilitate the use of OntoClean and to enable proper evaluation of it in real-world cases, we provide
AEON, a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate OntoClean
meta-properties. The implementation can be easily expanded to
check the concepts for other abstract meta-properties, thus providing for
the first time tool support in order to enable intensional ontology evaluation
for concepts. Our main idea is using the web as an embodiment of
objective world knowledge, where we search for patterns indicating concepts
meta-properties. We get an automatic tagging of the ontology, thus
reducing costs tremendously. Moreover, AEON lowers the risk of having
subjective taggings. As part of the evaluation we report our experiences
from creating a middle-sized OntoClean-tagged reference ontology."

For this purpose, eorts have been made to facilitate the ontology engineering process, in particular the acquisition of ontologies from domain texts. We present a general architecture for discovering conceptual structures and engineering ontologies. Based on the architecture we propose a new approach to extend current approaches, who mostly focus on the semi-automatic acquisition of taxonomies, by the discovery of non-taxonomic conceptual relations. We use a generalized association rule algorithm that does not only detect relations between concepts, but also determines the appropriate level of abstraction at which to define relations."

3296,"none","Ontologies have been widely accepted as the primary method of
representing knowledge in the Semantic Web. Knowledge Elicitation (KE)
is usually one of the first steps in building ontologies. A number
of ontology editors such as Protege have been developed to
assist users in building ontologies efficiently. However,
traditional KE techniques, such as card sorting
and laddering, are not yet supported, but performed manually and
outside of such tools.  In this paper we present a methodology and
a corresponding plug-in for Protege that allows
graphical ellicitation knowledge from documents using card sorting
and laddering approaches. Our aim is to seamlessly integrate the
KE techniques into the ontology building
process to make ontology building more efficient and less
error-prone. As a side-effect the persistent storage of card
sorting and laddering results allows for later traceability of ontology development.
KE largely depends on user interaction with the
plug-in, therefore we employed user-centred design principles to
capture requirements. After implementation, the plug-in was
evaluated thoroughly against the requirements. The evaluation
shows that this KE plug-in meets many of the
user's expectations and indeed saves them considerable time when
building ontologies."

3301,"none","Ontologies provide a shared understanding of a domain of interest to support communication among human and computer agents, typically being represented in a machine-processable representation language. Thus, ontologies are seen as key enablers for the Semantic Web. 
However, recently the convergence of paradigms such as currently being monitored in the areas of Semantic Web, Web Services, Agents, Peer-to-Peer networks and Grid Computing requires multi-disciplinary approaches and cooperation. This workshop is intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from the mentioned areas and to act as a platform for discussions for experiences and visions."
3302,"none","Ontologies provide explicit models of shared conceptualiza- tions, and are useful for modeling formal, semi-formal, and informal knowledge needed for communication within a company. As there is typ- ically more than one ontology used in a company (for instance one in each department), techniques are needed to merge ontologies in order to assure cross-company communication. In this paper, we summarize one such approach, called FCA{Merge. During its development, it turned out that a formal definition of `ontology' is needed. The resulting defini- tion is presented for the first time in detail in this paper."
3303,"none","Ontologies serve as a means for establishing a conceptually concise basis for communicating knowledge for many purposes. They are a popular research topic in Artificial Intelligence, e.g. knowledge engineering, natural language processing, intelligent information integration and multi-agent systems.

topic to real applications. This state of the art is emphasized by
the wide range of European projects with major industry
involvement and, in the same time, by the ever-growing interest of
small and medium size enterprizes asking for consultancy in this
domain. A core requirement in all of these efforts is, however,
the availability of proved and tested methods which allow an
emph{efficient} engineering of high-quality ontologies, be that
by reuse, new building or automatic extraction methods. Several
elaborated methodologies, which aid the development of ontologies
for particular application requirements, emerged in the last
decades. Nevertheless, in order for ontologies to be built and
deployed at a large scale, beyond the boundaries of the academic
community, one needs not only technologies and tools to assist the
engineering process, but also means to estimate and control
its overall costs. These issues are addressed only marginally by
current engineering approaches though their importance is well
recognized in the community. Different approaches exist to
estimate costs for engineering processes. We will present the
parametric cost estimation model ONTOCOM and its alignment with
the DILIGENT engineering methodology. Based on the resulting cost
function some analytical evaluations of application scenarios for
the DILIGENT model are provided."

3332,"none","Ontology alignment is a prerequisite in order to allow for interoperation between different ontologies and many alignment strategies have been proposed to facilitate the alignment task by (semi-)automatic means. Due to the complexity of the alignment task, manually defined methods for (semi-)automatic alignment rarely constitute an optimal configuration of substrategies from which they have been built. In fact, scrutinizing current ontology alignment methods, one may recognize that most are not optimized for given ontologies. Some few include machine learning for automating the task, but their optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontology concepts. With APFEL (Alignment Process Feature Estimation and Learning) we present a machine learning approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods. The methods are based on extensional and intensional ontology definitions. Core to APFEL is the idea of a generic alignment process, the steps of which may be represented explicitly. APFEL then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features and similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches. APFEL compares favorably in our experiments to competing approaches."

the study of fixed-point semantics for these paradigms. Several different
semantics have been proposed during the last two decades, and some have been
more successful and acknowledged than others. The rationales behind those
various semantics have been manifold, depending on one's point of view,
which may be that of a programmer or inspired by commonsense reasoning, and
consequently the constructions which lead to these semantics are technically
very diverse, and the exact relationships between them have not yet been fully understood. In this paper, we present a conceptually new method, based
on level mappings, which allows to provide uniform characterizations of
different semantics for logic programs. We will display our approach by
giving new and uniform characterizations of some of the major semantics,
more particular of the least model semantics for definite programs, of the
Fitting semantics, and of the well-founded semantics. A novel
characterization of the weakly perfect model semantics will also be
provided."

Structured peer-to-peer systems (like Chord) enforce a particular, global way of distributing data among the peers in order to solve this problem, but then encounter problems of network volatility and conflicts with the autonomy of the peer data management. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, INGA, which is based on the observation that query routing in social networks is made possible by locally available knowledge about the expertise of neighbors and a semantics-based peer selection function. We validate INGA by simulation experiments with different data sets. We  compare INGA with competing peer selection mechanisms on  resulting parameters like recall, message gain or number of messages produced."

In this context it is essential to figure out how critical situations can be detected in time, and how important changes can be discovered as early as possible. In particular analyzing potential exceptional states of performance indicators and matching counter measures in target-oriented simulation scenarios before implementing collaborative business processes is not supported by the current approaches. In this paper, we present a process-oriented approach to performance management of collaborative business processes, based on high-level Petri nets.

The goals of such a guidance component are  reuse  of (predefined) taskcomponents in order to decrease development time and to simplify the process of decomposing a KDD-task, task-oriented  planning  in order to break down complexity of a typical KDD-task and  supporting post-processing  (evaluation) of KDD-processes."

In the population based approach a set of solutions is transferred from one iteration of the algorithm to the next instead of transferring pheromone information as in most ACO algorithms. The set of solutions is then used to compute the pheromone information for the ants of the next iteration. The population based approach can be used to solve dynamic optimization problems when a good solution of the old instance can be modified after a change of the problem instance so that it represents a reasonable solution for the new problem instance. This is tested experimentally for a dynamic TSP and dynamic QAP problem. Moreover the behavior of different strategies for updating the population of solutions are compared."

While the availability of extensive PSM libraries and the emerging consensus on PSM specification languages indicate the maturity of the field, a number of important research issues are still open. In particular, very little progress has been achieved on foundational and methodological issues. Existing libraries of PSMs lack a clear theoretical basis and only provide weak support for the method development process, usually in the form of informal guidelines. In this paper we will address these issues by illustrating a framework which characterizes PSMs in terms of problem commitments, problem-solving paradigms and domain assumptions. This framework provides i) a theoretical foundation for situating PSM research and individual PSMs, as well as ii) an organization which allows us to characterize method development and selection as a process of navigating through a three-dimensional space (defined by the three components of our framework). Individual moves through this space are specified by means of adapters. In the paper we will illustrate these ideas in detail, with examples taken from parametric design problem solving."
3524,"none","Problem-Solving Methods: Making Assumptions for Efficiency Reasons"
3525,"none","Problem-solving methods (PSMs) for knowledge-based systems need to make assumptions to provide effective and efficient problem solving: assumptions about the scope of the problem they should solve and assumptions about the domain knowledge they can use as a resource for their reasoning process. If these assumptions are made explicit they can improve the reusability of PSMs by guiding the selection and refinement process of problem-solving methods for a given application and by defining goals for the acquisition process of domain knowledge. However, making the underlying assumptions explicit is not an easy task. The goal of our paper is to contribute to solve this problem. The main idea is to construct mathematical proofs and analysis of their failure as a systematic means for forming assumptions. Tool support is provided by adapting the Karlsruhe Interactive Verifier (KIV) for our purpose. KIV is an interactive theorem prover that returns with open goals if a proof could not be completed. These open goals can be used to derive the assumptions we are looking for."
3526,"none","Problem-solving methods are means to describe the inference process of knowledge-based systems. During the last years, a number of these problem-solving methods have been identified that can be reused for building new systems. However, problem-solving methods require specific types of domain knowledge and introduce specific restrictions on the tasks that can be solved by them. These requirements and restrictions are assumptions that play a key role in reusing problem-solving methods, in acquiring domain knowledge, and in defining the problem that can be tackled by the knowledge-based systems. In the paper, we discuss the different roles, assumptions play in the development process of knowledge-based systems and provide a survey of assumptions used by diagnostic problem solving. We show how such assumptions introduce target and bias for goal-driven machine learning and knowledge discovery techniques."

As part of this configuration process, developers must relate the ontologies of the generic methods to the ontologies associated with other methods and submethods. We present a model of method configuration that incorporates the use of several ontologies in multiple levels of methods and submethods, and we illustrate the approach by providing examples of the configuration of the board-game method."

In order to facilitate an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas which might lead to new, holistic approaches, the biennial conference series ""Professional Knowledge Management - Experiences and Visions"" was set up and held for the first time in March 2001 in Baden-Baden, Germany.

Based on ideas from the fields of statistics, machine learning and knowledge engineering we provided a general framework for defining user support. The general framework contains a combined top-down and bottom-up strategy to tackle this problem. In the current paper we describe the Algorithm Selection Tool (AST) that is one component in our framework.
AST is designed to support algorithm selection in the knowledge discovery process with a case-based reasoning approach. We discuss the architecture of AST and explain the basic components. We present the evaluation of our approach in a systematic analysis of the case retrieval behaviour and thus of the selection support offered by our system."

3889,"none","Purpose - This paper proposes solutions to problems related to the maintenance and update of already existing e-learning courseware. Design/methodology/approach - A structured approach in form of a reference model for the re-engineering of existing educational material is presented. In this context, concepts already established in the area of aspect-oriented programming are applied to deal with crosscutting concerns in e-learning material. Finally, a software product line approach is proposed for the creation of new courseware using re-engineered components. Findings - It turns out that some aspects of the methodology developed for aspect-oriented programming can also be used to restructure the existing e-learning material in such a way that maintenance is eased and redundancy is significantly reduced. In addition, software product lines for e-learning material provide a global framework for coordinating the re-engineering and reuse of components. Practical implications - The advantage of the proposed approach is that existing e-learning standards and systems do not have to be modified or adapted. Originality/value - Usually, courseware evolves during a longer period of time and its development does not start every time from zero. There is a high incentive for re-engineering of existing courseware, since it constitutes in many cases the competitive advantage of companies or universities. However, up to now, little attention is paid to the maintenance and the efficient update of e-learning material which is already there."

3891,"none","Python reached out to a wide and diverse audience in the last few years. During its evolution it combined a number of different paradigms under its hood: imperative, object-oriented, functional, listoriented, even aspect-oriented programming paradigms are allowed, but still remain true to the Python way of programming, thus retaining simplicity, readability and fun.
OWL is a knowledge representation language for the definition of ontologies, standardised by the W3C. It reaps upon the power of Description Logics and allows both the definition of concepts and their interrelations as well as the description of instances. Being created as part of the notoriously known Semantic Web language stack, its dynamics and openness lends naturally to the ever evolving Python language.
We will sketch the idea of an integration of OWL and Python, but not by simply suggesting an OWL library, but rather by introducing and motivating the benefits a really deep integration offers, how it can change programming, and make it even more fun."

in a web-compatible format, building on an elaborate object-model for describing concepts and relations. Thus, it might turn up as a natural choice for a widely-useable ontology description language. However, its lack of capabilities for describing the semantics of concepts and relations beyond those provided by inheritance mechanisms makes it a rather weak language for even the most austere knowledge-based system. This paper presents an approach for modeling ontologies in RDF(S) that also considers axioms as objects that are describable in
RDF(S). Thus, we provide flexible, extensible, and adequate means for accessing and exchanging axioms in RDF(S). Our approach follows the spirit of the World Wide Web, as we do not assume a global axiom specification language that is too intractable for one purpose and too weak for the next, but rather a methodology that allows (communities of) users to specify what axioms are interesting in their domain."

3920,"none","RDF-based P2P networks have a number of advantages compared to simpler
P2P networks such as Napster, Gnutella or to approaches based on
distributed indices on binary keys such as CAN and CHORD. RDF-based
P2P networks allow complex and extendable descriptions of resources
instead of fixed and limited ones, and they provide complex query
facilities against these metadata instead of simple keyword-based
searches.
In this paper we will discuss RDF-based P2P networks like Edutella as
a specific example of a new type of P2P networks - schema-based P2P
networks - and describe the use of super-peer based topologies for
these networks. Super-peer based networks can provide better
scalability than broadcast based networks, and provide support for
inhomogeneous schema-based networks, with different metadata schemas
and ontologies (crucial for the Semantic Web). Based on (dynamic)
metadata routing indices, stated in RDF, the super-peer network
supports sophisticated routing and distribution strategies, as well as
preparing the ground for advanced mediation and clustering
functionalities."

concept analysis (FCA), logic of domains, and answer set programming
(ASP) can be achieved. Based on these results for combining hierarchical
knowledge with classical rule-based formalisms, we introduce an expressive
common-sense query language for formal contexts. Although this
approach is conceptually based on order-theoretic paradigms, we show
how it can be implemented on top of standard ASP systems. Advanced
features, such as default negation and disjunctive rules, thus become
practically available for processing contextual data."
3947,"none","Recently the demand on business process modelling (BPM) became apparent in many different communities. To provide a unifying framework we propose an approach to integrate (well known) knowledge engineering techniques into a business process modelling context. We see knowledge based systems as one possibility (among others) to implement (re-engineered) business processes or parts thereof. Our framework is exemplified by integrating the MIKE approach (Model based and Incremental Knowledge Engineering) with ARIS (ARchitecture of Information Systems), a prominent representative of business process modelling. An important aspect of our framework is a proposal for linking business process models with a model of expertise."
3948,"none","Recently, the idea of semantic portals on the Web or on the intranet has gained pop-ularity. Their key concern is to allow a community of users to present and share knowledge in a particular (set of) domain(s) via semantic methods. Thus, semantic portals aim at creating high-quality access - in contrast to methods like information retrieval or document clustering that do not exploit any semantic background knowledge at all. However, by way of this construction semantic portals may easily suffer from a typical knowledge management problem. Their initial value is low, because only little richly structured knowledge is available. Hence the motivation of its potential users to extend the knowledge pool is small, too. We here present SEAL-II, a methodology for semantic portals that extends its previous version, by providing a range of ontology-based means for hitting the soft spot between unstructured knowledge, which virtually comes for free, but which is of little use, and richly structured knowledge, which is expensive to gain, but of tremendous possible value. Thus, we give the portal builder tools and techniques in an overall framework to start the knowledge process at a semantic portal. SEAL-II takes advantage of the ontology in order to initiate the portal with knowledge, which is more usable than unstructured knowledge, but cheaper than richly structured knowledge."
3949,"none","Recently, there has been an increased interest in the exploitation of background knowledge in the context of text mining tasks, especially text classification. At the same time, Kernel-based learning algorithms, especially Support Vector Machines, have become a dominant paradigm in the text mining community. This is also due to their capability to achieve more accurate learning results by incorporating a-priori knowledge by replacing standard linear kernels
of bag-of-words with the so called &amp;#8216;semantic&amp;#8217; kernels. In this paper we propose extensions and alternatives to previously proposed approaches to the design of semantic kernels by incorporating a variety of well-known measures of semantic similarity between terms. The experimental evaluation versus the standard linear kernel indicates that our approach improves performance in a variety of domains
while being consistently superior in cases where little training data is available."

An important factor for successful method reuse is the specification of preexisting methods and support in their task- and domain-specific refinements. The PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II approach allows developers to select methods from a library, and to map the methods to a domain ontology. KARL is a formal and executable knowledge-specification language that provides modeling primitives for expressing problem-solving methods. In this paper, we show how the code and informal descriptions of problem-solving methods in PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II can be supplemented with the formal method definitions in KARL. For our case study, we have chosen two methods from the PROTÃ‰GÃ‰-II framework: chronological backtracking and its task specific refinement: the board-game method. In the paper, we give insights in the refinement of general-purpose methods to task-specific (i.e., strong) problem-solving methods. We show further, how a task-specific method can be adapted to a given domain and application. In both cases this is achieved by introducing ontological commitments over the terminological structure of the entities used to describe the states of the reasoning process of a method."

As a particularity of our framework, CREAM allows to create relational metadata, i.e. metadata that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively rigid template-like schema as Dublin Core.

4167,"none","Semantic alignment between ontologies is a necessary precondition to establish interoperability
between agents or services using different ontologies. Thus, in recent years
different methods for automatic ontology alignment have been proposed to deal with
this challenge. Thereby, the proposed methods were constricted to one of two different
paradigms: Either, (i), proposals would include a manually predefined automatic
method for proposing alignments, which would be used in the actual alignment process. They typically consist of a number of substrategies such as finding similar
labels. Or, (ii), proposals would learn an automatic alignment method based on instance
representations, e.g. bag-of-word models of documents. Both paradigms suffer
from drawbacks. The first paradigm suffers from the problem that it is impossible,
even for an expert knowledge engineer, to predict what strategy of aligning entities
is most successful for a given pair of ontologies. This is especially the case with increasing
complexity of ontology languages or increasing amounts of domain specific
conventions. The second paradigm is often hurt by the lack of instances or instance
descriptions. Also, knowledge encoded in the intensional descriptions of concepts and
relations is only marginally exploited by this way.
Hence, there remains the need to automatically combine multiple diverse and complementary
alignment strategies of all indicators, i.e. extensional and intensional descriptions,
in order to produce comprehensive, effective and efficient semi-automatic
alignment methods. Such methods need to be flexible to cope with different strategies
for various application scenarios, e.g. by using parameters. We call them &amp;#8220;Parameterizable
Alignment Methods&amp;#8221; (PAM).We have developed a bootstrapping approach
for acquiring the parameters that drive such a PAM. We call our approach APFEL for
&amp;#8220;Alignment Process Feature Estimation and Learning&amp;#8221;."

Since in general, there can be more than one possibilities (combinations of web services) to achieve a certain goal, a user has to decide which of the alternatives suits him the best. This leads to the requirement that the combinations of web services must be comparable. This can be achieved by aggregating web service attributes. Since the ranking of web service combinations depends on user's needs, capabilities and willingness for ivestment of resources, considering user preferences is important while calculating the rank of a web service composition. We show, how user preferences as well as aggregation information can be modeled in a formal way and how web service combinations can be ranked automatically based on this information."

beyond theoretical studies which prove the
existence of connectionist systems for approximating

Advances were hindered severely by the
lack of concrete algorithms for obtaining the approximating

The systems are typically built on top of a database that contains profiles of employees and applicants. Thus, the skills may be retrieved through database queries. However, these approaches incur two major problems, viz. the finding of approximate matches and the maintenance of skill data. In this paper we describe two systems that leverage corporate skill knowledge by offering advanced means for both. We present ProPer that uses means from decision theory to allow for compensate skill matching. Then, we describe OntoProPer that combines these methods with intelligent means for inferencing of skill data. For the latter an ontology provides background knowledge, i.e. conceptual structures and rules, which supplement the skill database with ground and inferred facts from secondary information, such as project documents. These supplement facts re-duce maintenance efforts since much secondary information is gathered in the organizational memory through common working tasks.

Our work deals with the construction and reuse of knowledge base components from a knowledge engineering point of view. In order to reuse domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge experience has shown that powerful and integrated methods and tools are absolutely necessary.
Therefore we describe KARO (Knowledge Acquisition Environment with Reusable Ontologies) providing different means for retrieving and adapting concept definitions of a commonsense ontology as part of a domain model construction process. In our framework commonsense ontologies are defined as highly domain-independent knowledge bases containing conceptual definitions which formalise theories about, e.g., time, objects, space. We introduce the formal, linguistic and graphical methods, the architecture and other properties of KARO. By reusing these ontologies in a well-defined way conceptual domain models can be developed easier and made more robust.
In addition, we show how KARO and MIKE (Model-based and Incremental Knowledge Engineering Environment) are integrated in order to support the two main notions of reuse being investigated within knowledge engineering: the reuse of problem solving methods and the reuse of ontologies. Special emphasis is put on handling the interaction between problem solving methods and ontologies."

4247,"none","Standards in e-learning have been developed to support authoring, assembly, and execution of learning objects. Due to the fact that until now e learning is mainly applied in academic teaching, pricing of learning objects still plays a minor role in current research. So far, standards for learning objects lack concepts for the integration of prices. In this paper, we present an approach to support pricing of e-learning objects on different abstraction levels. The approach is based on combining price models and learning objects by extending the learning objects' XML metadata on the one hand and on the representation of processes as exchanges and manipulations of XML documents on the other hand. Consideration of price models in a workflow-based learning-object management system thus allows for explicitly modeling processes for pricing such as price negotiations between learners and learning object providers or mediators. Moreover, pricing processes can be integrated into learning, teaching, and administration processes and thereby enhance the cooperation of all participating actors."

4336,"none","Technical scenarios in areas like automotive or production systems will increasingly consist of a large number of components cooperating in potentially unlimited and dynamically changing networks to satisfy the functional requirements of their execution environment. Due to the high complexity it will be impossible to explicitly design the behaviour of the components for every potentially arising situation. Therefore, it will be necessary to leave an adequate degree of freedom allowing for a self-organised behaviour. Organic Computing (OC) has developed the vision of selforganising systems adapting robustly to dynamically changing environments without running out of control. This paper focuses on the design of a generic system architecture which allows for self-organisation but at the same time enables adequate reactions to control the, sometimes completely unexpected, emerging global behaviour of these self-organised technical systems."

Therefore, the success of the Semantic Web depends strongly on the proliferation of ontologies, which requires fast and easy engineering of ontologies and avoidance of a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Ontology Learning greatly facilitates the construction of ontologies by the ontology engineer. The vision of ontology learning that we propose here includes a number of complementary disciplines that feed on different types of unstructured, semi-structured and fully structured data in order to support a semi-automatic, cooperative ontology engineering process. Our ontology learn-ing framework proceeds through ontology import, extraction, pruning, refinement, and evaluation giving the ontology engineer a wealth of coordinated tools for ontology modeling.

We present ontologies as means to enrich web documents for representing semantic information for overcoming this bottleneck. Ontologies enable informed search for information as well as the derivation of additional knowledge that is not directly represented as facts in the WWW. Such an ontology can be used by a subgroup of web users that share a common point of interest like it is known from newsgroups in the internet. Therefore, we propose ontologies to be used to annotate intranets or certain subnets within the entire WWW. The paper presents such an ontology that can be used to annotate web documents of a research community. In fact, we have chosen the knowledge acquisition community. Further, an architecture of an ontology-based broker is sketched that can make use of these ontologies for the automatic derivation of knowledge."

4445,"none","The diversity and availability of information sources on the World Wide Web has set the stage for integration and reuse at an unparalleled scale. There remain signi.cant hurdles to exploiting the extent of the Web's resources in a consistent, scalable and maintainable fashion. The autonomy and volatility of Web sources complicates maintaining wrappers consistent with the requirements of the data's target application. Also, the sources' semantic heterogeneity requires practical methods to mediate their contents. This paper describes our e.orts in developing an algebra on semistructured data. This algebra is the tool we use to develop and maintain wrappers, and mediate their semantic content. We describe wrapper creation, re.nement and maintenance as the process of developing a congruity measure between source data sets and their target application. The congruity measure expresses explicitly the context within which the source data is relevant for its target use. Enabling mediation between wrappers corresponds to establishing an articulation between data sources through a similarity measure. The similarity measure encapsulates conditions under which distinct sources may be used together. Examples using the algebra show how the Summarize operator enables creation and maintenance of a target data set from a source. We de.ne the Match operator and demonstrate its use in mediating the content of similar sources. We have applied these two operators respectively to an online dictionary with over 125,000 di.erent terms, and to the web pages of NATO gov- ernments and their allies. We give a description of the rule language that we use to wrap and mediate sources, and conclude with the applications that motivate the other operations in the algebra."

However, some problems arise if ER modelling is applied to the design of really large databases concerning whole enterprises. There is, e.g., no way to obtain a general view nor to perceive the global context of a detailed enterprise scheme with hundreds of entities and relationships. Different approaches use ER model clustering to overcome these problems. All approaches are based on an already existing detailed ER diagram. Based on this, the abstraction layers are built bottom-up. The approach proposed in this paper refines and extends the approaches mentioned above. It also takes into account the Nested Entity Relationship Model in order to refine relationship types. It can be used in a top-down database design process as well as in a bottom-up approach."

4450,"none","The focus of research on representing and reasoning with knowledge traditionally has been on single specifications and appropriate inference paradigms to draw conclusions from such data. Accordingly, this is also an essential aspect of ontology research which has received much attention in recent years. But ontologies introduce another new challenge based on the distributed nature of most of their applications, which requires to relate heterogeneous ontological specifications and to integrate information from multiple sources. These problems have of
course been recognized, but many current approaches still lack the deep formal backgrounds on which todays reasoning paradigms are already founded. Here we propose category theory as a  well-explored and very extensive mathematical foundation for modelling distributed knowledge. A particular prospect is to derive conclusions from the structure of those distributed knowledge bases, as it is for example needed when merging ontologies."
4451,"none","The general topic of this thesis is the investigation of various notions of morphisms between logical deductive systems, motivated by the intuition that additional (categorical) structure is needed to model the interrelations of formal specifications. This general task necessarily involves considerations in various mathematical disciplines, some of which might be interesting in their own right and which can be read independently.<br><br>
 
To find suitable morphisms, we review the relationships of formal logic, algebra, topology, domain theory, and formal concept analysis (FCA). This leads to a rather complete exposition of the representation theory of algebraic lattices, including some novel interpretations in terms of FCA and an explicit proof of the cartestian closedness of the emerging category. It also introduces the main concepts of Â«domain theory in logical formÂ» for a particularly simple example.<br><br>
 
 In order to incorporate morphisms from FCA, we embark on the study of various context morphisms and their relationships. The discovered connections are summarized in a hierarchy of context morphisms, which includes dual bonds, scale measures, and infomorphisms.<br><br>
 
Finally, we employ the well-known means of Stone duality to unify the topological and the FCA-based approach. A notion of logical consequence relation with a suggestive proof theoretical reading is introduced as a morphism between deductive systems, and special instances of these relations are identified with morphisms from topology, FCA, and lattice theory. Especially, scale measures are recognized as topologically continuous mappings, and infomorphisms are identified both with coherent maps and with Lindenbaum algebra homomorphisms."

Data correlation and inference technologies can be used as core components to build Autonomic Computing systems. They can be used to perform an automated, continuous analysis of enterprise-wide event data, based on user-defined, configurable rules, e.g. for detecting threats or system failures. Furthermore, they may trigger corrective actions for protecting or healing the system. 
In this paper, we discuss the use of ontologies as a high-level, expressive conceptual modelling approach for describing the knowledge on which the processing of a   correlation engine is based upon. By introducing explicit models of state-based IT resources in the correlation technology approach, Autonomic Computing systems can be built which are able to deal with policy based goals on a higher abstraction level.

4454,"none","The increasing popularity of e-learning has lead to the creation of an
abundance of learning material. Very often, after the initial creation, the growing amount of content also leads to a more complicated content maintenance, since updates typically occur very often and the potential variability of modifications is
not limited in advance. Moreover, commonalities between different parts of material are not exploited, which often leads to redundancy. The composition of content from different sources rarely produces satisfactory results. To help remedy this situation, this paper introduces the PROduct Lines for dIgital COntent (PROLICO) approach, which applies the concept of software product lines to digital content, and in particular, to educational material in e-learning. The PROLICO approach manages explicitly the commonalities in learning material by defining

For symbolic paradigms that use the syntax of some first-order language this appears to be particularly difficult. In this paper, we will extend on an idea proposed by Garcez and Gabbay (2004) and show how first-order logic programs can be represented by fibred neural networks. The idea is to use a neural network to iterate a global counter n. For each clause Ci in the logic program, this counter is combined (fibred) with another neural network, which determines whether Ci outputs an atom of level n for a given interpretation I. As a result, the fibred network computes the singlestep operator TP of the logic program, thus capturing the semantics of the program."

Current standardization efforts include e.g. the W3C recommendation for the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Knowledge Discovery is defined by U.M. Fayyad as ""the nontrivial process of identifying valid, previously unknown, potentially useful patterns in data"". 
We foresee two ways of combining these areas. On the one hand, mining for the semantic web includes the application of knowledge discovery methods and techniques to support the setting up of the semantic web itself. Prominent examples are here ontology learning and population of ontologies (instance learning). On the other hand, mining from the semantic web emphasizes the usage of semantic web technologies for mining purposes such as e.g. the usage of taxonomies in recommender systems, applying association rules with generalizations or clustering with background knowledge in form of ontologies."

4466,"none","The paper describes a development approach for knowledge-based systems (KBS) combining semiformal and formal techniques for specification and design. For the semiformal representation we use a hypermedia-based formalism which serves as a communication basis between expert and knowledge engineer during knowledge acquisition.

In the design phase, this representation is enriched by additional language primitives which focus on issues of realization and which facilitate the mapping of the model of expertise to the implementation environment. A smooth transition from semiformal to formal specification and further on to design is achieved as all the description techniques rely on the same conceptual model to describe the system.

For the semiformal representation we use a hypermedia-based formalism which serves as a communication basis between expert and knowledge engineer during knowledge acquisition. The semiformal knowledge representation is also the basis for formalization, resulting in a formal and executable model of expertise specified in the Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language (KARL). Since KARL is executable the model of expertise can be developed and validated by prototyping. A smooth transition from a semiformal to a formal specification and further on to design is achieved as all the description techniques rely on the same conceptual model to describe the functional and non-functional aspects of the system. Thus, the system is thoroughly documented at different description levels, each of which focuses on a distinct aspect of the entire development effort. Traceability of requirements is supported by linking the different models to each other. Though the MIKE approach aims at supporting the building process of kbs, its principles and methods apply also to the development of non-knowledge-based software systems, e.g. information systems."

We identify different elements of such a specification: a task definition, a problem-solving method, a domain model, an adapter, and assumptions that relate these elements. We present abstract data types and a variant of dynamic logic as formal means to specify these different elements. Based on our framework we can distinguish several verification tasks. In the paper, we discuss the application of the Karlsruhe Interactive Verifier (KIV) for this purpose. KIV was originally developed for the verification of procedural programs but it fits well for our approach. We illustrate the verification process with KIV and show how KIV can be used as an exploration tool that helps to detect assumptions necessary to close the gap between the task definition and the competence of a problem-solving method."
4474,"none","The paper introduces an approach for the specification and verification of knowledge-based systems that combines conceptual and formal techniques. We identify four elements of the specification of a knowledge-based system: a task definition, a problem-solving method, a domain model, and an adapter that relates the other elements. We present abstract data types and a variant of dynamic logic as formal means to specify and verify these different elements. As a consequence of our conceptual model we can decompose the overall verification task of the knowledge-based systems into different proof obligations. Each proof obligation deals with a different aspect of the entire system. The use of the conceptual model in specification and verification improves understandability and reduces the effort for both activities. The modularization enables reuse of specifications and proofs. A knowledge-based system can be build by combing and adapting different components."

The learning target is to find a set of goal clauses which can be used to define a target predicate. That is, we deal with single-predicate learning. For the search process we use the learning algorithm JoJo/Frog which provides a flexible search strategy. The transition from the first-order representation to the representation in propositional logic is achieved by ground substitutions which transform clauses into ground clauses. Taking a closer look at this transition makes clear that the sufficiency condition which is used by algorithms like FOIL and LINUS as a criterion for judging the achieved learning results does not correspond to the completeness condition in the propositional case. Therefore, we use an extended completeness condition which captures all information given by the example knowledge. As a consequence we get a new definition of positive and negative examples. Instead of ground facts we regard ground substitutions as examples."
4477,"none","The paper presents an approach for using a bidirectional search strategy for inductively learning clauses in a restricted first-order language. The learning target is to find a set of goal clauses that describe the true ground facts of a given target predicate. In our example setting we further assume that the background knowledge is also given in the form of true (and false) ground facts of each background predicate. By fixing the number of variables allowed in the derived clauses we show that no explicit negative goal facts are needed in the case of the closed-world assumption since the rules are evaluated from the premise to the head rather than binding the variables of the goal literal first. As a consequence we get an efficient ILP algorithm that tries to minimize the tuples of variable substitutions stored at each step of our covering approach."

Using the closure of the Galois connection, we define two new bases for association rules which union is a generating set for all valid association rules with support and confidence. These bases are characterized using frequent closed itemsets and their generators; they consist of the non-redundant exact and approximate association rules having minimal antecedents and maximal consequents, i.e. the most relevant association rules. Algorithms for extracting these bases are presented and results of experiments carried out on real-life databases show that the proposed bases are useful, and that their generation is not time consuming."

4484,"none","The rapid-prototyping approach of the early 1980's failed to deliver high-quality knowledge-based systems. As a reaction, in the early 90's, there has been a large activity in the knowledge engineering community to define methodologies for principled knowledge-based system development. These methodologies (e.g., CommonKADS, MIKE, VITAL, TASK) succeeded in organising the development process as a set of intermediate models of the functionality of the system to be built, to end in the final implementation. Feedback from industries that use these methodologies in practice reveals, however, that building a high-quality implemented system remains a difficult and error-prone process. The main reason for this is that, although the structure of the development process is rather well understood, the transition process is less clear. In this paper, we outline an approach for assuring the transition of a conceptual model into a final implementation which satisfies particular quality criteria. The approach is based on identifying adequate transition paths and activities on models in order to achieve particular quality criteria. An essential part of the approach is formed by methodological guidelines and tool support such as change-management systems, reusable libraries, translators, decision support tools, and support for validation and verification."

In this article, we show how this can be achieved by high-level Petri nets&#8212;namely, the so-called NR/T-nets (Nested-Relation/Transition Nets). In NR/T-nets, the structural part is modeled by nested relations, and the behavioral part is modeled by a novel Petri net formalism. Each place of a net represents a nested relation scheme, and the marking of each place is given as a nested relation of the respective type. Insert and delete operations in a nested relational database (NF2-database) are expressed by transitions in a net. These operations may operate not only on whole tuples of a given relation, but also on &#8220;subtuples&#8221; of existing tuples. The arcs of a net are inscribed with so-called Filter Tables, which allow (together with an optional logical expression as transition inscription) conditions to be formulated on the specified (sub-) tuples. The occurrence rule for NR/T-net transitions is defined by the operations union, intersection, and &#8220;negative&#8221; in lattices of nested relations. The structure of an NR/T-net, together with the occurrence rule, defines classes of possible information system procedures, i.e., sequences of (possibly concurrent) operations in an information system."

4489,"none","The subject of the book is the Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Language KARL which is a formal and operational specification language for knowledge-based systems. It provides language primitives to represent knowledge according to the layers of a KADS-oriented model of expertise. The main features of KARL are: It provides epistemologically adequate modelling primitives allowing knowledge specifications at the so-called knowledge level. It is a formal knowledge specification language. That is, it has a declarative semantics. It is an operational knowledge specification language which allows prototyping. Chapter one introduces the basic idea of KARL. The main object of KARL is to fill or to narrow the gap between the implementation and the conceptual description of a knowledge-based system by defining a formal and operational specification language. It is related to the symbol level because it is a language with a formal and operational semantics. It is related to the knowledge level because it abstracts from all implementational details which are concerned with the realization by an efficient implementation. Chapter two, three, and four introduce the language KARL itself. KARL consists of the two languages L-KARL and P-KARL. Chapter two introduces the language L-KARL which is used to model static knowledge. P-KARL which is used to model procedural knowledge (i.e., knowledge about the control flow of a problem-solving method) is described in chapter three. Finally, chapter four shows how these languages and their interaction are used to model the domain layer, the inference layer, and the task layer of a model of expertise. Then, the mathematical semantics of KARL is defined in chapter five. A model-theoretic semantics is defined which allows a precise and unique specification of knowledge-based systems. Besides KARL, some other languages have been developed during the last few years which aim to formalize or operationalize KADS models of expertise. Besides all technical details, the main difference between KARL and the other languages is the fact that KARL aims to be a formal and operational knowledge specification language. The object here is not only operationalization in principle, i.e., the possibility of using a kind of theorem-proving, but also an efficient evaluation to allow prototyping. In the conclusion, we compare KARL with one these languages which where developed as part of the KADS project. We also characterize some shortcomings of KARL and outline aspects of future work with it."
4490,"none","The success of the Semantic Web crucially depends
on the easy creation, integration and use of semantic data. For
this purpose, we consider an integration scenario that defies core
assumptions of current metadata construction methods. We describe
a framework of metadata creation when web pages are generated from
a database and the database owner is cooperatively
participating in the Semantic Web. This leads us to the definition
of ontology mapping rules by manual semantic annotation and the
usage of the mapping rules and of web services for semantic
queries. In
order to create metadata, the framework combines the presention
layer with the data description layer --- in contrast to
``conventional'' annotation, which remains at the presentation
layer. Therefore, we refer to the framework by deep
annotation
We consider deep annotation as particularly valid because, (i), web pages generated from databases outnumber static
web pages, (ii), annotation of web pages may be a very
intuitive way to create semantic data from a database and, (iii), data from databases should not be materialized as
RDF files, they should remain where they can be handled most

4491,"none","The technical challenges associated with the development and
deployment of ontologies have been subject to a considerable
number of research initiatives since the beginning of the
nineties. The economical aspects of these processes are, however,
still poorly exploited, impeding the dissemination of
ontology-driven technologies beyond the boundaries of the academic

this situation by proposing ONTOCOM (ONTOlogy
COst Model), a model to predict the costs
arising in ontology engineering processes. We introduce a
methodology to generate a cost model adapted to a particular
ontology development strategy, and an inventory of cost drivers
which influence the amount of effort invested in activities
performed during an ontology life cycle. We further present the
results of the model validation procedure, which covered an
expert-driven evaluation and a statistical calibration on
36 data points collected from real-world
projects. The validation revealed that ontology engineering
processes have a high learning rate, indicating that the building
of very large ontologies is feasible from an economic point of
view. Moreover, the complexity of ontology evaluation, domain
analysis and conceptualization activities proved to have a major
impact on the final ontology engineering process duration."

restricted impact was confirmed in a three month empirical
study, in which we examined over 36 contemporary ontology

4493,"none","The tremendous success of the World Wide Web is countervailed by
efforts needed to search and find relevant information. For
tabular structures embedded in HTML documents typical keyword or
link-analysis based search fails. The Semantic Web relies on
annotating resources such as documents by means of ontologies and
aims to overcome the bottleneck of finding relevant information.
Turning the current Web into a Semantic Web requires automatic
approaches for annotation since manual approaches will not scale
in general. Most efforts have been devoted to automatic generation
of ontologies from text, but with quite limited success. However,
tabular structures require additional efforts, mainly because
understanding of table contents requires a table structures
comprehension task and a semantic interpretation task, which
exceeds in complexity the linguistic task. The focus of this paper
is on automatic transformation and generation of semantic
(F-Logic) frames from table-like structures. The presented work
consists of a methodology, an accompanying implementation (called
TARTAR) and a thorough evaluation. It is based on a grounded
cognitive table model which is stepwise instantiated by the
methodology. A typical application scenario is the automatic
population of ontologies to enable query answering over arbitrary

arise in that scenario. Firstly, it is difficult to locate
ontologies to be reused, thus leading to many ontologies modeling
the same thing. Secondly, current tools do not provide means for
reusing existing ontologies while building new ontologies.

DCT (Data Characterisation Tool) is implemented in a software environment (Clementine). Some examples are given that resulted from running the UGM/DCT (User Guidance Module combined with DCT) on the data.
Finally we will provide some examples based on UCI datasets and consider the improvements we made w.r.t. other approaches as well as what we gained using this extension to our User Guidance Module (UGM) for user support."
4528,"none","This paper discusses and compares two different approaches to model-based knowledge acquisition. That is, we regard the Model-based and Incremental Knowledge Engineering (MIKE) approach and the Configurable Role-limiting Method approach (CRLM). MIKE is based on the distinction of different phases in the software development process. It uses the formal and operational knowledge specification language KARL allowing a precise and unique description of a model of expertise which is the outcome of the analysis phase. CRLM is based on the role-limiting method approach. Role limiting shells are implementations of strong problem-solving methods and substantially simplify knowledge acquisition through guidance by predefined models of problem-solving and by sophisticated graphical user interfaces. The main disadvantages, namely inflexibility and brittleness, are to some degree overcome by the CRLM where the problem-solving methods are split into smaller parts, which can then be reconfigured allowing the integration of new methods or other method combinations. Although these two approaches are often discussed as contradictory, we, however, experienced that both approaches complete each other very well. As an outcome of our comparison, we outline topics of future research for both approaches."

Digital Libraries, which makes use of two different sources for change detection

derived from the actual usage of ontologies. Second, we describe the generation
of data-driven ontology changes based on the constant flow of documents coming
into Digital Libraries. The proposed framework for ontology ontology evolution, which is
currently applied and evaluated in case studies, significantly reduces the costs
of ontology updates and improves the quality of the ontology with respect to the

4537,"none","This paper presents an approach to support the top-down development of knowledge based systems. We propose to use predefined knowledge elements for eliciting, structuring, and formalizing the knowledge. The predefined elements are arranged in a library. We differentiate between three types of reusable knowledge elements: generic problem solving methods (PSMs), generic concept taxonomies and template forms from which rule templates are generated in accordance to the concrete application. The generic PSMs as well as the generic concept taxonomies of our library is described informally and formally so that they can be used at the one hand as guidelines for elicitation and on the other hand as basis for the formalization which has to be modified according to the application. For integrating the principle of reuse we propose different tools that support the usage of the predefined methods, concepts and template forms from the library. The paper gives an overview of our library components as well as of our reuse principles. Moreover, the tools supporting the top-down knowledge acquisition are introduced."

Such systems have to support interorganizational workflows which are mainly characterized by interoperability, autonomy and openess. Interoperability is enabled through Web Services, providing required functionalities of integration and flexibility, and by using applied ebXML as communication language. The proposed system consists of three main IT nodes: a workflow system for administration and control of information flows; Web Services enabling data transfer between computers; and a Web Server controlling all applications for communication with all users in each organization. The proposed model of the Workflow Enactment Server consists of two nodes: the Rule Based Collection, and the Workflow Engine. The Rule Based Collection consists of a set of rules mapping the requirements of the involved organizations. The workflow engine consists of two components A and B for process execution and control."

KARO supplements the reuse of generic problem-solving methods at the task and inference layers in MIKE with a commonsense ontology at the domain layer. The intention is to make the development process easier and the final domain layer more robust. In order to reuse ontologies powerful and integrated tools and methods are absolutely necessary. Therefore, we will describe the formal, linguistic and graphical methods, the architecture and other properties of KARO. We will enrich this survey with several examples which clarify the modeling process of the domain layer in a scheduling task using MIKE. We will show the integration of KARO and MIKE in respect of the development of the domain layer of a model of expertise. We finish the paper with a comparison of related approaches."

Considering language and system particularities, this first layer of representation is then translated into the target representation language. This two-layer approach benefits engineering, because the intended meaning of axioms is captured by the categorization of axioms. Classified object representations allow for versatile access to and manipulations of axioms via graphical user interfaces."

discussions and exchanges:
(1) Within the eSkills Forum set up by the Commission in spring 2003 created to
support cooperation between stakeholders and experts on ICT- and E-Business
skills;
(2) With the European and International Training industry and social partners engaged in ICT certification issues;
(3) To prepare a next phase of the CEN/ISSS (European Committee of Normalization/Information Society Standardization System) ICT-Skills workshop in order to elaborate a European meta-ICT skills or qualifications framework.
This issue has to be seen also in relation to current discussions on European level initiatives on Transparency (Europass), Credit Transfer and overarching European skills and qualification frameworks in view of realising wider policies linked to the
Lisbon goals and agreed education and training objectives.
The nature of the activities required specialist knowledge, skills and services in order to meet the demands of animating a continuing exchange and generating,
reviewing, analyzing and reporting on thematically organized information and
knowledge for underpinning the policy-making process in line with the European Union's eEurope action plan (in partnership with the industries' own efforts) as well as to identify and promote training solutions and certification in the area of ICT and E-Business skills and last but not least to further contribute to the implementation of the e-Learning Action Plan of the European Union."

4573,"none","To achieve better interoperability among intelligent applications, and to relieve knowledge engineers from the burden of developing ontologies from scratch, it is critical to reuse ontologies. However, there are two main reasons why the reuse of ontologies is rare: (1) current ontology repositories allow only simple keyword-based search facilities, and (2) even when a user finds an ontology, the information about the ontology quality and (re)usability is not available.

In this paper, we present an Open Rating System based approach for ontology evaluation. The core Open Rating System model is extended with topic-specific trust to provide more accurate personalized ontology rankings. Our model is partially implemented in Knowledge Zone - a webbased ontology repository where users can submit their ontologies, annotate them with metadata, search for existing ontologies, find out their rankings based on user reviews, post their own reviews, and rate reviews."

In this paper, we define a mapping system for OWL-DL ontologies, where mappings are expressed as correspondences between conjunctive queries over ontologies. As query answering within such a general mapping system is undecidable, we identify a decidable fragment of the mapping system, which corresponds to OWL-DL extended with DL-safe rules. We further show how the mapping system can be applied for the task of ontology integration and present a query answering algorithm."

4754,"none","We address the problem of efficiently  ranking the best peers w.r.t.
a query with multiple, equally weighted predicates -- conjunctive
queries -- in shortcut overlay networks. This problem occurs when
routing queries in unstructured peer-to-peer networks, such as in
peer-to-peer information retrieval applications. Requirements for
this task include, e.g., full autonomy of peers as well as full
control over own resources.  Therefore prominent resource location
and query routing schemes such as distributed hash tables can not be
applied in this setting. In order to tackle these requirements we
combine a new resource location and query routing approach that
exploits social metaphors of topical experts and experts' experts
with standard IR measures for ranking peers based on collection-wide
information. The approach has been fully tested in simulation runs
for skewed data distributions and network churn and has been
partially implemented in the 
Bibster system."
4755,"none","We argue that non-functional requirements are the driving force behind the design decisions in the MIKE approach to the development of knowledge-based systems. We outline the model adopted in MIKE to record the rationale of design decisions by explicitly linking them to non-functional requirements and indicate how the evaluation of the design wrt. the posed requirements can be integrated into the development process."
4756,"none","We argue that the field of neural-symbolic integration
is in need of identifying application scenarios
for guiding further research. We furthermore argue
that ontology learning - as occuring in the context
of semantic technologies - provides such an

high impact on neural-symbolic integration."
4757,"none","We describe an approach towards integrating the semantics of semi-structured documents with task- support for (weakly-structured) business processes and proactive inferencing capabilities of a desk sup- port agent. The proactive assistance of the intelli- gent agent is motivated by the requirements posed in (weakly-structured) business processes performed by a typical knowledge worker. First, we introduce a reactive agent that provides knowledge out of an organizational memory for the business task at hand. The building of the reactive agent requires rather rigid query structures that do not _t nicely with varying precision of knowledge found in the organizational memory. Thus, we propose an enhanced agent that reasons proactively about what might be interesting to you and what might be dueinyour next step."

4759,"none","We have now reached a stage in the lifecycle of semantic
technologies, where a major integrative effort is needed, so as
to produce the infrastructure that the community requires. A
large-scale effort is needed to tackle the 'holistic' problem of
an effective integration of technologies and methods. This
effort would make the acquisition, design, development and
maintenance of large, heterogeneous semantic applications,
which are now, in principle, feasible, more cost-effective."
4760,"none","We introduce the notion of iceberg concept
lattices and show their use in Knowledge Discovery in Databases
(KDD). Iceberg lattices are a conceptual clustering method, which
is well suited for analyzing very large databases. They also serve
as a condensed representation of frequent itemsets, as starting
point for computing bases of association rules, and as a
visualization method for association rules. Iceberg concept
lattices are based on the theory of Formal Concept Analysis, a
mathematical theory with applications in data analysis,
information retrieval, and knowledge discovery.
We present a new algorithm called Titanic for computing (iceberg)
concept lattices. It is based on data mining techniques with a
level-wise approach. In fact, Titanic can be used for a more
general problem: Computing arbitrary closure systems when the
closure operator comes along with a so-called weight function.
Applications providing such a weight function include association
rule mining, functional dependencies in databases, conceptual
clustering, and ontology engineering. The algorithm is
experimentally evaluated and compared with B. Ganter's
Next-Closure algorithm. The evaluation shows an important gain in
efficiency, especially for weakly correlated data."

This kind of conceptual statements is argued to be close to intuitive human reasoning. We provide a deduction calculus for cumulated clauses on FLE that is obviously sound and give an elaborated proof for its completeness."
4763,"none","We investigate the formal specification of the dynamic reasoning process of knowledge-based systems. The main contributions of the paper are: defining a formal framework for describing the dynamic reasoning behaviour of knowledge-based systems which unifies existing approaches; defining a semantics for the specification of the dynamic reasoning behaviour of a knowledge-based system within the states as algebra setting that overcomes several shortcomings of the existing approaches; and providing for the first time an axiomatization and proof theory of specification languages for knowledge-based systems. We achieve this by developing the logical language MLPM (Modal Logic of Predicate Modification)."
4764,"none","We investigate the formal specification of the reasoning process of knowledge-based systems. We analyse the corresponding parts of the KADS specification languages KARL and (ML)2 and deduce some general requirements for such specifications. The essence of these languages is that they integrate a declarative specification of inferences with control information. The languages differ in the way they achieve this integration and each of them has shortcomings. We propose a unifying semantical framework that integrates the core of the different solutions and overcomes their problems. We define a semantics and axiomatization with the logic MLCM (Modal Logic of Creation and Modification). MLCM was developed to reason about dynamic properties of the specification language COLD. MCL (Modal Change Logic) is a generalization of MLCM based on experience in applying MLCM to knowledge-based systems and specifications with evolving algebras. The main contribution of the paper is not to introduce yet another specification language. Instead we aim on four goals: (1) defining a framework for describing the dynamic reasoning behaviour of knowledge-based systems which integrates existing approaches; (2) defining a semantics for the specification of the dynamic reasoning behaviour of a knowledge-based system within the states as algebras setting of MLCM that overcomes several shortcomings and ad-hoc solutions of existing approaches; and (3) providing an axiomatization that enables the development of mechanised proof support. (4) Through conceptual and semantical clarity, we investigate the relationships to similar work in software engineering and database engineering opening possibilities for further cross-fertilization of these fields."

ontologies, and present our methodology for ontology development

commercial aspects."
4766,"none","We present a MOF compliant metamodel and UML profile for the
Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) that integrates with our previous work on a metamodel

visual modelling of rule-extended ontologies."
4767,"none","We present a framework to represent distributed knowledge based on many-valued logics, combined with bilattices. The use of these truth-value spaces enables us to express fuzzy, incomplete and even inconsistent knowledge. At a supervisory level of such a systeman, decision-theoretic result should be applied to match divergent statements or preferences. We describe some strategies that are useful for this purpose."
4768,"none","We present a new kind of heuristic guidance as an extension to the Population-based Ant Colony Optimization (P-ACO) implemented in hardware on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The heuristic information is obtained by transforming standard heuristic information into small time-scattered heuristic-vectors of favourable ant decisions. This approach is suited for heuristics which allow for an a priori calculation of the heuristics information. Using the proposed method, an ant can build-up a solution in quasi-linear time. Experimental studies measure the performance of the
time-scattered heuristic. A comparison with the standard heuristic and candidate lists is also given."
4769,"none","We present a novel approach of extracting a domain ontology from
large-scale thesauri. Concepts are identified to be relevant for a
domain based on their frequent occurrence in domain texts. The
approach allows to bootstrap the ontology engineering process from
given legacy thesauri and identifies an initial domain ontology
that may easily be refined by experts in a later stage. We present
a thorough evaluation of the results obtained in building a
biosecurity ontology for the UN FAO AOS project."
4770,"none","We present a novel approach to the automatic acquisition of taxonomies
or concept hierarchies from a text corpus. The approach is based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a method mainly used for the analysis of data,
i.e. for investigating and processing explicitly given information. 
We follow Harris' distributional hypothesis and model the context
of a certain term as a vector representing syntactic dependencies 
which are automatically acquired from the text corpus with a linguistic parser. 
On the basis of this context information, FCA produces a lattice
that we convert into a special kind of partial order constituting
a concept hierarchy. 
The approach is evaluated by comparing the resulting concept hierarchies
with  hand-crafted taxonomies for two domains: tourism and finance.
We also directly compare our approach with hierarchical agglomerative
clustering as well as with Bi-Section-KMeans as an instance of a divisive clustering
algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of using different
measures weighting the contribution of each attribute as well as of applying 
a particular smoothing technique to cope with data sparseness."
4771,"none","We present a preliminary version of the approximate OWL reasoning system SCREECH. It builds on the KAON2 system and performs OWL ABox reasoning in an approximate manner. It trades soundness of reasoning for efficiency, with resulting polynomial worst-case data complexity. It has been developed for use in time-critical applications
where quick response time is more important than a full guarantee of correctness of answers. The
theoretical background for the system is explained in [Hitzler and Vrandecic, Proc. ISWC 2005]."
4772,"none","We present a scalable and reliable framework for Semantic Portals which is an extension of our existing SEAL approach. We illustrate the instantiation of our framework by the real-world example of a heterogeneous and distributed infrastructure of Semantic Portals, viz. the portal of our institute AIFB, the OntoWeb.org portals and the KM-Vision.org portal. The approach relies on the application of current semantic technologies whereby we still keep practical usability. Generally, we show that our approach can be used to build up Semantic Portals from scratch or to build up on existing portal infrastructures as a layered Semantic Portal on top. We present several modi for integration of multiple portals and show how we address practical issues like scalability and robustness of Semantic Portals."
4773,"none","We present a structured approach for developing problem-solving methods for knowledge-based systems. We view this process as a stepwise combination process of methods and adapters. We start from very generic search strategies with very general data structures and add adapters that refine the states of the search process, that refine state transitions, and that add assumptions necessary to link the competence of a method with given problem definitions and domain knowledge. The paper provides three novel contributions to knowledge engineering. First, we provide a structured approach for the development and adaptation of problem-solving method. Second, we show how the usability-reusability trade-off of task-specific versus task-independent problem-solving methods can easily be overcome by the virtual existence of specific methods. Third, we provide the concept of an integrated library combining reusable problem definitions, problem-solving methods, and adapters."
4774,"none","We present a user-centered model for porting natural language
interfaces (NLIs) between domains efficiently.
The model assumes that domain experts without any background knowledge
about computational linguistics will perform the customization
of the NLI to a specific domain. In fact, it
merely requires familiarity with the underlying knowledge base as well
as with a few basic subcategorization types. Our model is iterative in
the sense that the adaption of the NLI is performed in several cycles 
on the basis of the questions which the NLI failed to answer, thus
iteratively increasing the coverage of the system.
We provide experimental evidence in form of a user study as well as
a case study involving a real-world application corroborating that our 
model is indeed a feasible way of customizing the interface to a certain 
domain."
4775,"none","We present a workbench for integrating Web documents into semantically enriched representations suitable on the Semantic Web. The approach benefits on the one hand from thefacilities provided by Semantic Web technologies and on the other

4776,"none","We present our work in integrating Semantic Web services
for access via mobile devices. We have developed a system,
theWebServiceAccessComponent, that transforms a user request
for a service on a mobile device, to a Web service request

Web services of the Deutsche Telekom, which provide navigational

the requirements and design of the WebServiceAccessComponent."
4777,"none","We present semantic management of Web Services as a paradigm that is located between the two extremes of current Web Services standards descriptions and tools, which we abbreviate by WS*, and Semantic Web Services. On the one hand, WS* does not have an integrated formal model incurring high costs for managing Web Services in a declarative, but mostly manual fashion. On the other hand, the latter aims at the formal modelling of Web Services such that full automation of Web Service discovery, composition, invocation, etc., becomes possible &#8212; thereby incurring unbearably high costs for modelling. Based on a set of use cases, we identify who benefits from what kind of semantic modelling of Web Services, when and for what purposes. We present how an ontology is used in an implemented prototype."
4778,"none","We present the SmartWeb Demonstrator for multimodal and
mobile querying of semantic resources and the open WWW. The
end-user interface consists of a Pocket Data Assistant which
accepts written or spoken questions as input and delivers answers
based on a multitude of resources including a semantic knowledge
base, semantically annotated online web services, and semiautomatically
created knowledge from text-based web pages. If
answers cannot be found using these structured resources, then the
system returns answers based on linguistic query-answering
techniques on the open WWW."
4779,"none","We present the Web Service Description Framework (WSDF), which provides both a representation mechanism and a runtime system architecture for semantically enriched Web Services. We analyze existing languages such as BPEL4WS and OWL-S before addressing their deficiencies in our proposal. Our approach allows a client to invoke a service based solely on a shared ontology, i.e. without prior knowledge on the API, providing an important building block towards a global, flexible information infrastructure. Another main point is that WSDF can be applied to clients and services written in a conventional object oriented programming language. This is achieved by lifting datastructures to an ontology level in which rich logical statements about services can be formalized. We also present a detailed system architecture that covers planning, invocation, and the automatic processing of the service results, which is accomplished using the observer design pattern and by asserting the result in the respective model. Furthermore, the required annotations can be specified conveniently by placing comments in the source code."
4780,"none","We present the architecture of an intelligent broker for enabling the use of problem-solving methods via the World Wide Web (WWW). The core component of such a broker is realised by an ontologist and an adapter. Ontologies mediate between domain-specific requirements and knowledge, task-specific problem descriptions and method-specific terms describing the competence and requirements of the reasoning components. The ontological reasoning for relating the different ontologies is supported by the ontologies. Adapters are necessary to provide domain knowledge and case data to problem-solving methods and to rephrase the output of problem-solving methods into domain-specific terms. Therefore, the ontologist mediates the selection and adaptation process of PSMs whereas the adapter mediates the execution of them."
4781,"none","We propose a new technique for approximate ABox reasoning

ontologies into negation-free disjunctive datalog, and on the idea of performing

The most notable achievements featured in this paper are a runtime reduction and including the approximation of the heuristic function by a small set of favored decisions which changes over time."

4808,"none","When applying Inductive Logic Programming techniques in real-world settings, many problems will come up. Since not many real-world applications are reported using ILP-techniques this report describes some problems that may appear when starting such a project. The project was done in co-operation with HÃ¶gdalenverket, a heat and power plant burning household refuse in the Stockholm area, Sweden. The application problems with collecting data and the application of ILP-techniques are discussed. Results of tests performed while using SPECTRE, an ILP-algorithm developed at Stockholm University, are reported. These results show that the addition of background knowledge and addition/retraction of parameters has positive effect on the performance of the ILP-techniques. After initial tests a knowledge acquisition stage was started. This resulted in knowledge about the domain that was used for evaluating the results of learning using SPECTRE. This prevented several mistakes by interpreting data and evaluating performance. This knowledge was partly used as background knowledge for the learning algorithm. Noise handling was applied and increased the efficiency of the SPECTRE-algorithm. The paper lists the results of tests performed on data from the refuse-burning plant. It also compares the performance of the SPECTRE-algorithm on theoretical databases with the performance on this practical domain. It also gives some insight in the change of performance that can be expected when transferring from the laboratory-domains to domains gathered in the real-world."

4810,"none","While the stable model semantics, in the form of Answer Set
Programming, has become a successful semantics for disjunctive logic
programs, a corresponding satisfactory extension of the well-founded semantics
to disjunctive programs remains to be found. The many current
proposals for such an extension are so diverse, that even a systematic
comparison between them is a challenging task. This is mainly caused
by the completely different mechanisms applied in the approaches. In order
to aid the quest for suitable disjunctive well-founded semantics, we
present a systematic approach to a comparison based on level mappings,
a recently introduced framework for characterizing logic programming
semantics, which was quite successfully used for comparing the major
semantics for normal logic programs. We extend this framework to disjunctive
logic programs and present alternative characterizations for the
strong well-founded semantics (SWFS), the generalized disjunctive wellfounded
semantics (GDWFS), and the disjunctive well-founded semantics
(D-WFS). This will allow us to gain comparative insights into their
different handling of negation."

4819,"none","Wikipedia is the biggest collaboratively created source of
encyclopaedic knowledge. Growing beyond the borders of any traditional encyclopaedia, it is facing new problems of knowledge management: The current excessive usage of article lists and categories witnesses the fact that 19th century content organization technologies like inter-article references and indices are no longer sufficient for today's needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Rather, it is necessary to allow knowledge processing in a computer assisted way, for example to intelligently query the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the introduction of &lt;i&gt;typed links&lt;/i&gt; as an extremely simple and unintrusive way for rendering large parts of Wikipedia machine readable. We provide a detailed plan on how to achieve this goal in a way that hardly impacts usability and performance, propose an implementation plan, and discuss possible difficulties on Wikipedia's way to the semantic future of the World Wide Web. The possible gains of this endeavor are huge; we sketch them by considering some immediate applications that semantic technologies can provide to enhance browsing, searching, and editing Wikipedia."

4842,"none","With rising importance of knowledge interchange, many industrial and academic applications have adopted ontologies as their conceptual backbone. However, industrial and academic environments are very dynamic, thus inducing changes to application requirements. To fulfill these changes, often the underlying ontology must be evolved as well. As ontologies grow in size, the complexity of change management increases, thus requiring a well-structured ontology evolution process. In this paper we identify a possible six-phase evolution process and focus on providing the user with capabilities to control and customize it. We introduce the concept of an evolution strategy encapsulating policy for evolution with respect to userâ€™s requirements."
4843,"none","Without the proliferation of formal semantic annotations, the
Semantic Web is certainly doomed to failure. In earlier work we
presented a new paradigm to avoid this: the 'Self Annotating Web',
in which globally available knowledge is used to annotate
resources such as web pages. In particular, we presented a
concrete method instantiating this paradigm, called PANKOW
(Pattern-based ANnotation through Knowledge On the Web). In
PANKOW, a named entity to be annotated is put into several
linguistic patterns that convey competing semantic meanings. The
patterns that are matched most often on the Web indicate the
meaning of the named entity --- leading to automatic or
semi-automatic annotation.
In this paper we present C-PANKOW (Context-driven PANKOW), 
which alleviates several shortcomings of PANKOW. First, by downloading 
abstracts and processing them off-line, we avoid the generation of large
number of linguistic patterns and correspondingly large
number of Google queries.
Second, by linguistically analyzing and normalizing the downloaded
abstracts, we increase the coverage of our pattern matching
mechanism and overcome several limitations of the earlier pattern
generation process. Third, we use the annotation context in order
to distinguish the significance of a pattern match for the given
annotation task. Our experiments show that C-PANKOW
inherits all the advantages of PANKOW (no training required etc.),
but in addition it is far more efficient and effective."

5102,"none","bstract: We present a novel approach to the automatic acquisition of taxonomies or concept hierarchies from a text corpus. The approach is based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a method mainly used for the analysis of data, i.e. for investigating and processing explicitly given information. We follow Harris' distributional hypothesis and model the context of a certain term as a vector representing syntactic dependencies which are automatically acquired from the text corpus with a linguistic parser. On the basis of this context information, FCA produces a lattice that we convert into a special kind of partial order constituting a concept hierarchy. The approach is evaluated by comparing the resulting concept hierarchies with hand-crafted taxonomies for two domains: tourism and finance. We also directly compare our approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering as well as with Bi-Section-KMeans as an instance of a divisive clustering algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of using different measures weighting the contribution of each attribute as well as of applying a particular smoothing technique to cope with data sparseness."

CEPIS studied on behalf of Cedefop the situation of e-Skills Certification in Europe. The study identified voluntary approaches offered by widely applied e-skills certifications. The operational objective for this study has been the evaluation of issues of e-skills certification at the International and European level by analysing attitudes of stakeholders towards current and future European level activities and highlighting potential solutions and recommendations to perceived problems. Based on the achieved results and outcome of the conducted study, the authors propose and illustrate a possible path towards internationally agreed certifications and recognised qualifications throughout Europe."

The term ?Semantic Web? encompasses efforts to build a new WWW architecture that enhances content with formal semantics, which enables better possibilities for navigating through the cyberspace and accessing its contents. As such, the Semantic Web represents a promising technology for realizing eLearning requirements. This paper presents an approach for implementing the eLearning scenario using Semantic Web technologies. It is primarily based on ontology-based descriptions of content, context and structure of the learning materials and thus provides flexible and personalized access to these learning materials."

8197,"none","iMapping is a technique for visually structuring information objects. It supports the full range from informal note taking over semi-structured personal information management to formal knowledge models. With iMaps, users can easily go from overview to fine-grained structures while browsing, editing or refining the knowledge base in one comprehensive view. 

An iMap is comparable to a large white-board where information items can be positioned like post-its but also nested into each other. Spatial browsing and zooming as well as graphical editing facilities make it easy to structure content in an intuitive way. iMapping builds on a zooming user interface approach to facilitate navigation and to help users maintain an overview in the knowledge space. 
While a first implementation is being developed, iMapping is still in a conceptual stage. In this paper we describe the iMapping approach and how it tries to combine and extend the advantages of other approaches."
8198,"none","iMapping is a visual technique for structuring information objects. It is based on research in the fields of visual mapping techniques, Information Visualisation and cognitive psychology. iMapping uses a Zooming User Interface to facilitate navigation and to help users maintain an overview in the knowledge space. An iMap is comparable to a large whiteboard where wiki-pages can be positioned like post-its but also nested into each other. Augmenting Wikis by providing spatial browsing and zooming facilities makes it easier to structure content in an intuitive way. Especially semantic wikis, which typically contain more fine-grained content, and stress the structure between information items, can benefit from a graphical approach like iMapping, that allows to display multiple such items and multiple wiki-pages in one view. This paper describes the iMapping approach in general, and briefly how it will be applied as a rich client front-end to the SemWiki engine."

8214,"none","m Folgenden werden unterschiedliche Vorgehensweisen zur Entwicklung wissensbasierter Systeme (WBS) aufgezeigt. In der Praxis noch weit verbreitet ist der Ansatz des Rapid Prototyping. Beim Rapid Prototyping wird informales Wissen unmittelbar in einer operationalen WissensreprÃ¤sentationsform oder einer Programmiersprache implementiert. Eine andere Vorgehensweise setzt sog. Role Limiting Methoden voraus. Role Limiting Methoden sind ausfÃ¼hrbare Werkzeuge, die bereits alles Wissen zur LÃ¶sung von Problemen eines speziellen Typs enthalten. Sie mÃ¼ssen nur noch um das bereichsspezifische Wissen angereichert werden. Bei modellbasierte Entwicklungsmethoden werden eine Reihe aufeinanderfolgender Modelle bis hin zum endgÃ¼ltigen System entwickelt, deren Detaillierungs- und Formalisierungsgrad zunimmt. Der Beitrag skizziert alle drei Vorgehensweisen und zeigt deren Vor- und Nachteile und deren Einsatzgebiete auf."
