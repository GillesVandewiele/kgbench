# KGBench datatype

KGBench datasets contain bty-to-string encoded literals. These string literals encode byte-level data, potentially containing images, video or audio (although only images are currently used in the datasets).

We define the following datatypes:
 
*`http://kgbench.info/dt#base64Image` An image encoded as a base64 string. 
*`http://kgbench.info/dt#base64Audio` An audio sequence encoded as a base64 string.
*`http://kgbench.info/dt#base64Video` A video encoded as a base64String.
